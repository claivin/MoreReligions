 ##Hungary and breakaway Missions
 
 knn_diplo_second_title: "Secure Kievan Alliance"
 knn_diplo_second_desc: "Kiev has responded to our diplomatic request - that they still, even after all this time, have our back in this civil war. Now, if we can convince their Khan to fully back our invasion, the Blue Horde can begin their invasion on our behalf so that we might unify all of Hungary!"
 knn_diplo_first_title: "Gather Natural Allies"
 knn_diplo_first_desc: "In the initial Hungarian Interregnum of the 14th Century, the Blue Horde backed house Kan in their rebellion against the Ladislaus pretenders. They backed us primarily because of the Orthodox faithful that reside within our land, and as such, we confirmed with them that those of the Eastern Church would have protection under our rule."
 knn_conquest_first_title: "Riders of the Kan"
 knn_conquest_first_desc: "We shall ride out from our fortress in the east - our cavalry are the bane of the Civil War and can defeat almost all that dare try to fight against us!"
 knn_conquest_second_title: "End The Civil War"
 knn_conquest_second_desc: "Since 1449, the civil war has ravaged the land of the Magyars. Thousands have died in combat and even more from the plague, pillaging, and the famines that often accompany war. Things cannot remain like this. We must finally defeat the other Oligarchs, and once more crown the next king of Hungary."
 knn_spy_first_title: "Infiltrate The Enemy"
 knn_spy_first_desc: "The conflict we face right now cannot be solely resolved through force. It will take cunning diplomacy to manage it. Since the conflict emerged from within the old state, we still have connections and allies in foreign courts. If we can get into communication with them, perhaps we can use that to our advantage?"
 knn_spy_second_title: "Incite Uprisings"
 knn_spy_second_desc: "We have gathered allies - all we need to do now is ship supplies over to them. Using the hidden road networks and forgotten trade routes, we will funnel them into our enemy's fortresses and unleash them upon our foes!"
 knn_buda_first_title: "Secure Pest"
 knn_buda_first_desc: "In order to fully showcase our legitimacy, we must secure the ancient capital of the Hungarian Kingdom - Pest. We must ensure that the violence of war and the brutality of the conflict has not reached this place should we want to project power throughout our realm."
 knn_buda_second_title: "Growth of the Capital"
 knn_buda_second_desc: "With the civil war ended, the Capital can once more begin to grow. First, we must take citizens from the surrounding fields and bring them into the great walls of Pest. All around the old city will new living quarters and housing be created for them, expanding the wealth and prestige of our capital."
 knn_buda_third_title: "Etyek-Buda Vineyards"
 knn_buda_third_desc: "The wine production near Buda and Etyek has often been…poor. THis was often due to bad production capabilities or the conflict ruining the ability for farmers to properly harvest and manage the crop. Now, with an era of peace around the region, we can fully expand and grow the vineyards into what they were meant to be - bountiful and world renowned."
 knn_buda_fourth_title: "A Renaissance City"
 knn_buda_fourth_desc: "The city of Buda will be a world renowned place of education and scholarship when we are finished with it. It will be the home of great libraries and museums, where religious and secular researchers can meet and discuss new findings."
 knn_buda_fifth_title: "The Founding of Budapest"
 knn_buda_fifth_desc: "The nearby city of Buda has grown more and more interconnected with the capital, and so it is high time we integrate them into our land."
 knn_raid_first_title: "Raid of Krakow"
 knn_raid_first_desc: "Krakow is home to many riches and goods. It is a massive production center for the Polish Emperors - perhaps we should take it for ourselves…"
 knn_raid_second_title: "The Razing of the Countryside"
 knn_raid_second_desc: "The Polish Emperors draw power not just from their metropolitan cities, but from their vast fields of peasants working the land. These serfs are the true backbone of the Empire, so if we were to take that from them, burn their crop and let their kings starve in behind great stone walls, we could defeat them without having to even invade Warsaw."
 knn_raid_third_title: "Securing the Borderlands"
 knn_raid_third_desc: "Between the Kievan Rus and the Polish Emperor are a wild, untamed land of marshes and forests. Here, cossacks and other slavic groups run their small fiefdoms - we shall make them submit to our rule by fortifying our holdings and rulings."
 knn_raid_fourth_title: "Conquest of Warsaw"
 knn_raid_fourth_desc: "The time has come. Their warriors are weakened, their people are drained, and there is none left to stop us. We shall crush their resistance and take Warsaw for ourselves!"
 knn_raid_fifth_title: "Ending the Emperor"
 knn_raid_fifth_desc: "The Emperor of the Germans can no longer be allowed to threaten our land. His reign is over, and his lands shall be rendered asunder. There will be nothing but ash and dust when the Magyar Horde is through with him."
 knn_raid_sixth_title: "Lords of the East"
 knn_raid_sixth_desc: "We have dominated the Poles, Slavs, and Kipchacks. None remain to stand in our way - they are all too weak and fragmented. With our conquests, they shall be brought into the fold."
 knn_religion_first_title: "Conversion of Carpathia"
 knn_religion_first_desc: "The lands of the Magyars are mostly followers of the Western Church. The house of the Kan was catholic, but many of the Cumans and Hungarians living in the region were not. We adopted the faith to accommodate these new powers in our realm, and we must do the same to all of the Pannonian Basin."
 knn_religion_second_title: "Churches for the Faithful"
 knn_religion_second_desc: "In order to facilitate this transition from Western Catholicism to the Eastern Orthodoxy, we must build more churches. These centers for the faith can help spread and facilitate religious growth across our realm."
 knn_religion_third_title: "Approval of the Patriarchs"
 knn_religion_third_desc: "The Patriarchs of Kiev hold immense sway over our liturgical tradition. Since much of our tradition is based on the Slavic writings and customs, we must seek guidance from them on how best to conduct our practice."
 knn_religion_fourth_title: "Leaders of Orthodoxy"
 knn_religion_fourth_desc: "The Orthodox faith is disunited. The Blue Horde is an oppressor of the Tverian princes, while the Byzantines have fallen and been ruined. We must take up the mantle of protector of all the faithful, and lead our people into a new era."
 knn_conquest_third_title: "End the Oligarchs"
 knn_conuest_third_desc: "The Oligarchs have been defeated, but there are holdouts across the land. We must strip them of their autonomy and prevent them from rebelling or attacking our provinces any more!"
 knn_army_first_title: "Legacy of the War"
 knn_army_first_desc: "The Civil War has taught us much. We have defeated thousands of foes in battle, and we can only stand to learn more."
 knn_army_second_title: "Masters of the Saddle"
 knn_army_second_desc: "From atop our great steeds, we ride. Through flatlands and marsh, between mountain ranges and over tundra and snow, our cavalry power through the enemy with a thundering crash. We are the lords of the steppe and the plain, from the Carpathian ranges to the Pannonian basin."
 knn_raid_seventh_title: "Fortify the Frontier"
 knn_raid_seventh_desc: "The Frontier must be protected. If we establish forts and build up our settlements in these regions, we can align the Ruthenian people before launching an attack into the northernmost reaches of the Rus."
 knn_blh_first_title: "Invade Wallachia"
 knn_blh_first_desc: "The Wallachian plains would be a good place to start our invasions. Their land is mostly flat and wooded, so we can easily send raiding parties to seize the forts in the region and push out any occupying Kipchak peoples."
 knn_blh_second_title: "Dominate Bulgaria"
 knn_blh_second_desc: "The Bulgar Khans have been a thorn in our side since the 12th Century. Our predecessors granted the Ban of Severin to the Joannite order specifically to manage them, though if they failed at doing so in the end. It is time for a direct approach - we shall burn the city to the ground, razing it until it is nothing but ash!"
 knn_blh_third_title: "The Fields of Ruthenia"
 knn_blh_third_desc: "Ruthenia has hundreds of fields of wheat and grain. The soil is fertile, the grazing land is plentiful, and the settled peoples and nomads both coexist within this space. For us, this can be a land that our people settle in for centuries to come. The Cuman tribesmen have ancient traditions that they recall - of their time in these plains, roaming and raiding with great ease. Perhaps it is time to return to this land, and reclaim it for ourselves."
 knn_blh_fourth_title: "Dethrone the Great Khan"
 knn_blh_fourth_desc: "The Great Khan of Kiev is our final foe. We have reclaimed the title of Lord of the East, and we have showcased how our armies are superior and more experienced in battle. At last, we shall defeat and dethrone these fools, these arrogant curs who thought they could dominate us just because we allowed them to assist us. We shall break their order, destroy their holdings, and claim what is rightfully ours."
 knn_blh_fifth_title: "The Kunsag Horde"
 knn_blh_fifth_desc: "In that ancient era, we too were nomads. Not the Cumans, not the Kipchak, but the Magyar. We roamed from Asia to Europe, raiding and razing as we pleased. We shall return to this tradition, aided by our Cuman and Mongol brethren, and reclaim the world as our personal grazing ground."

They came to our aid, and with their support we conquered all of the lands of the Magyars. However, recently, we have been betrayed. They demanded that we, their most trusting of allies, become a tributary to them. This affront cannot stand. We are the masters of our own destiny, and we shall not bend the knee to any foreign Khan!

 #Siam Missions
#Siam Missions
 mr_siam_conquest_1_title: "Rally the Levies"
 mr_siam_conquest_1_desc: "In maintaining independence, one must ensure the presence of an army through which the cities of the realm can be defended from all the hungry eyes that wish to seize them for themselves. To keep the Khmer from deeming us weak and malleable, and in turn to expand the reaches of our own influence; should the opportunity for such a thing ever arise"

 mr_siam_conquest_2_title: "Unite the Muangs"
 mr_siam_conquest_2_desc: "It takes no genius to figure that the fragmented status quo in Siam benefits no-one but the Khmer overlords over in Angkor, who no doubt have had a heavy hand in playing the various cities of their mandala against one another, keeping us all weak and splintered for the sake of propping up their wealth and their imperial ambition.\n\nWe must put an end to this charade, and unite the Thai people under one banner- our banner, by force if we have to. Our brethren may not welcome us at first, but in time they'll understand that our interests are the very same as theirs"

 mr_siam_conquest_3_title: "Conquer Chiang Mai"
 mr_siam_conquest_3_desc: "History has so far been nothing but kind to the lords of Lan Na, who have since time immemorial paid little heed to the goings on of the broader world around them, and have managed to carve themselves and the northern Thai a prospering kingdom, worthy of one's respect. The conquest of Lan Na, and of course of the great city Chiang Mai, however, is a crucial move that we must make- for the sake of the great Empire which we're trying to carve"

 mr_siam_conquest_4_title: "Reclaim Ayodhya"
 mr_siam_conquest_4_desc: "Ayutthaya lies at the very core of Siam, and has long served as an area through which the Khmer maintained their dominion over the Thai people- therefore it is only natural that the Khmer want to keep a tighter leash around this crucial city. Of course, that also means that if we are to unite our people- we will have to go and actively, openly defy the Khmer Empire for it. The upcoming fight is neither easy nor will it be pleasant, but it is crucial for the survival of the cause- and the longevity of our fledgling state as a whole"

 mr_siam_conquest_5_title: "Challenge the Khmer"
 mr_siam_conquest_5_desc: "The Khmer Empire, centered in Angkor, has long been a force that has existed to the very detriment of Siam and the Thai people- practically built off all the gold we paid them and all the food we've grown for them. The prosperity of our lands has been funneled away for far too long, and this travesty must come to an end-\nthe Khmer must learn that we'll be their mules no longer!"

 mr_siam_conquest_6_title: "Invade Vientiane"
 mr_siam_conquest_6_desc: "Not far off the site of our latest triumphs against the Khmer lie the lands of the Lao and their city of Vientiane. While not the most notable, and definitely not the richest of places in the region; the acquisition of that city can nonetheless prove to be a worthwhile endeavor- at the very least in providing us with a central, defensible and strategic location in the west of Indochina, connected to China and Vietnam and open to their lucrative markets as it is" 

 mr_siam_conquest_7_title: "Ensure Laotian Loyalty"
 mr_siam_conquest_7_desc: "Our recent conquest of Vientiane has aroused quite the negative perception of us from the Lao people, who no doubt view us as a new oppressor; one that violently barged in and ended an era of independence and self determination. We wish not to cultivate such a gnarly image of ourselves in our subjects' minds, however- we must instead convince them that we- as their suzerains- first and foremost care about them and their rights as people of the realm.\n\nWhile that may not necessarily be true, there is also nothing to be gained in antagonising them. We must bring what little remains of Lao independence to an end, and once the region is consolidated- perhaps then a show of benevolence on our part may be warranted; in tolerating them and their local superstitions"

 mr_siam_angkor_1_title: "The Sacking of Angkor"
 mr_siam_angkor_1_desc: "It's about time we took this whole protracted conflict and pushed it back to where it all started; to the mighty city of Angkor, bringing a much-awaited end to this brutal epoch in our history.\nBy merely taking over the beating heart and soul of the once-mighty Khmer Empire, however, their people; our oppressors, those who once held such thorough sway over us will never bow before us, at least not in honesty.\n\nIf we are to rule in harmony, then, we'll be forced to take dire measures to humble their character, and imprint on them all a valuable lesson on what it means to stand against us. If Siam is to rise, then Angkor is to burn"

 mr_siam_angkor_2_title: "Expansion of Thai Influence"
 mr_siam_angkor_2_desc: "The dust has settled, and the sands of time have shifted and changed; taking what remains of Angkor at last with them, long after its demise at our very hands.\n\nLeaving things off with the Khmer at an act of cruelty is not what we ultimately have in mind for the region however, as we indeed do see intrinsic value in it and in the productivity of its people.\nIn rebuilding the bridges between our people that years of war have torn, we'll have to appease them- offer them jobs and opportunities within our court and working to tolerate their cultural norms..\n\nAlternatively, we could also just force our religion upon them instead; While it'll stir quite a nerve now- give it a generation or two and they too will start calling themselves pure-blooded Thai, just like the rest of us"  

 mr_siam_angkor_3_title: "Rulers of Siam"
 mr_siam_angkor_3_desc: "The Khmer have fallen and the Lao have submitted, and most of Indochina now lies in our hands. Siam has reached heights never-before witnessed by its people, with us acting as the very architects of this auspicious change.\n\nWe have carved ourselves an Empire in all but name- so let us change that too, and in crushing what little, fleeting resistence there is left in these lands- we can proclaim our rightful supremacy and affirm our place among the nations of the world as a proper Empire" 

 mr_siam_dev_1_title: "Rebuild the Thai Cities"
 mr_siam_dev_1_desc: "Siam is just not what it used to be; our cities have shrunk, our population has dwindled, and our coffers have been stretched as thin as they can be. This, if anything, is a pungent wake-up call. if we wish to see our people thrive and live their best lives, and if we wish to see our home united and strong again, we must then do what we can with what money we have to rebuild our cities- to expand upon them, and to make sure that the taxes being paid all reach our coffers to the dime.\nSo that our sons and daughters may inherit a home just a bit richer, and just a bit more prosperous"

 mr_siam_dev_2_title: "A City Across the River"
 mr_siam_dev_2_desc: "Due south of Ayutthaya, down along the banks of the Chao Phraya lies a little-known trading town by the name of Bangkok that has long been at the center of our court's attention.\n\nSituated in the near-middle of our Mandala, positioned at the delta of the Chao Phraya, and with its proximity to the coast all kept in mind- Royal sponsorship of the town's growth and the further development of the local trades, tapping into its boundless potential, can very well turn this meagre little market town into something greater. It has all the makings of a grand capital-to-be"

 mr_siam_dev_3_title: "Floating Rice Paddies"
 mr_siam_dev_3_desc: "Rice is the means through which we sustain our ever-growing population; it cheap, easy to plant, easy to harvest, and easier yet to cook. Easy and cheap, however, can be made easier and cheaper; with much larger yields. Regulating the harvest of deepwater rice around the Chao Phraya, with dedicated state-owned facilities and organised planting will provide sustenance for even millions of people across the land, letting our cities grow larger and the men in our armies more ever-more numerous"

 mr_siam_dev_4_title: "The Merchant Quarter"
 mr_siam_dev_4_desc: "Ever since our sponsorship of the town of Bangkok it has managed to develop into a proper city in its own right, separate; if not wholly distinct from Ayutthaya to its north. With its urban growth, however, also come issues of logistics- as the city has recently outgrown its old commercial districts, and many of the merchants who come to sell their wares there find no venue to do so. In addressing the problem; city planners have come before the court with a proposal- a new quarter for the merchants to operate in alongside a dock to accommodate their ships. New infrastucture will have to be laid out to make these plans work, of course, but if current trends are to be believed; such an investment will be quick to pay itself off"

 mr_siam_elephants_1_title: "The Siamese Cavalry"
 mr_siam_elephants_1_desc: "In Thai society elephants have since time immemorial served in a wildly varying assortment of roles; from beasts of burden to steeds of war- generally, its importance in our functions as a state cannot be overstated. Promoting programs to selectively breed stronger and stronger herds of elephants under our state's surveillance will provide a breed of elephant with which our armies will be able to strike fear at the hearts of our enemies, and lay waste to all resistance they may mount against us"

 mr_siam_elephants_2_title: "Royal Elephant Protection"
 mr_siam_elephants_2_desc: "Elephants are mighty beasts indeed, but there's just not too many of them to go around. In protecting our existing herds and providing them with all they need to multiply, the elephant population of Siam is sure to see a boom- and with it, the elephants that our army gets to use"
 mr_siam_karma_start_title: "Allignment with the Sangha"
 mr_siam_karma_start_desc: "The Buddhist Assemblies hold much sway over the cultural and spiritual life of the Thai people, by raising temples and expanding their reach in our lands we could then- perhaps- earn their favor, something which will turn become quite the powerful playing card in our future dealings with the Buddhism's faithful; within and without our sphere of influence"

 mr_siam_karma_2_title: "The Shifting Mandala"
 mr_siam_karma_2_desc: "Orbits within orbits; the mandala system focuses on the idea that from the center of a state; a great circle is formed, the orbit of which inhabit weaker, subservient states; bound to pay tribute to it. In a great ladder, those weaker states may in turn have circles of their own- which in turn unravels and extends all the down to the very level of the individual. In building a respectable state, we must attract and secure the fielty of smaller states around the orbit of our very own Mandala"

 mr_siam_karma_final_title: "The Eternal Chakravatin"
 mr_siam_karma_final_desc: "The King of the Universe; He who rules over all four continents, through which all things function and are kept in order- is a man of Buddhist ideals, who commands the respect of all those under him, and makes those who he deems his enemies fear him.\n\nLet our ruler be one such man, then, let him command the respect and adulation of mighty kings- and uphold the principles of Buddhism throughout the land" 
 mr_siam_karma_3_title: "Theravada Architecture"
 mr_siam_karma_3_desc: "In a line of good deeds to make note of the monarchy's exemplary moral character, we would do well to sponsor the development of some key Thai cities beyond our center of power; to bring prosperity to their people, and to set them up as exemplary pieces of Theravada Thai culture- ones that our neighbors will in turn wish to emulate themselves in their own domains in style and character"

 mr_siam_capital_1_title: "Fortify the Palace"
 mr_siam_capital_1_desc: "The Lord's Palace is the very center of our Muang's power, the home of the treasury, and the heart of the political apparatus. By letting it be vulnerable, and open to outside attacks; it, the city itself, and the state as a whole come under dire scrutiny. We must do what we can with what money we have to fortify it and protect ourselves, then- be it from rebels or from foreign armies"

 mr_siam_dev_5_title: "The City of Gods"
 mr_siam_dev_5_desc: "Bangkok has come a long way in its recent history; from being little over a river town living under Ayutthaya's shadow to being the very epicenter of a vast and dominant Empire- Its a city matched by very few in Asia when it comes to size and sheer affluence, nevertheless, we know it can be made even than that.\n\nOne grand renovation, public works of all kinds and magnitudes; from the small and convenient to the grand and opulent- Palaces rivalling the Sun in brilliance and urban sprawl as far as the eye can see. Let Bangkok become a synonym to majesty in the eyes of the world, an entrepot in which all the world's riches culminate, and one whose citizens may rival even foreign kings in wealth and riches" 

 mr_siam_burma_1_title: "Rival Pagan"
 mr_siam_burma_1_desc: "The resurgent Pagan Kingdom of Burma is a state that is cause for much concern; it's a rising, influential power that undoubtedly sees us and our war-weary lands as ripe for the taking, and one that wouldn't hesitate to put us all in the ground if it served to further its ambitions.\n\nWith Siam now united, we must rise to the occasion on and take a firm stance against the Burmese and their ambitions"

 mr_siam_burma_2_title: "Sieze the Mon Kingdom"
 mr_siam_burma_2_desc: "The Mon Kingdom, albeit small, holds sway over rich and fertile lands at the mouth of the Irrawaddy river, from Bago itself to Dagon and Pathein to west. Divided and weak; It is a land ripe for the taking, and as the key to Burma- it'll be a conquest through which we'll be sowing the seeds to something much, much greater"

 mr_siam_burma_3_title: "Up the Irrawaddy"
 mr_siam_burma_3_desc: "With the conquest of Lower Burma finalised not too long ago, it is now due time we striked true at the heart of the enemy- at the fertile watershed of the Irrawaddy River- and crippled them for good at long last.\n\nThe Bamar people will all be forced to bend the knee, and the Burmese Crown shall become but one of many trophies in our King's collection"

 mr_siam_burma_4_title: "Control the Borderlands"
 mr_siam_burma_4_desc: "One approach our generals have proposed in dealing with the Burmese threat is to advance through the Karenni hills to the direct east of Burma proper. It's a region that has never quite known centralised rule from Pagan, and a region that is weak and fragmented- at best. It's only natural we seized such a strategic position, then- lest the Burmese do it themselves and hold it against us instead"

 mr_siam_burma_5_title: "Conquer the Shan Hills"
 mr_siam_burma_5_desc: "A crucial step to the integration of Burma to the demesne is the far north, where the Muangs of the Shan Hills have long held a tradition of autonomy and self rule- historically in spite of numerous Burmese attempts at bringing them to the fold. With that considered, let us succeed now where our rivals failed and tame the Shan. Controlling these hills, beyond granting us an advantageous position against the Burmese- will also, perhaps, signal to them that in yet another aspect of statecraft and politics; we are their betters"

 mr_siam_burma_6_title: "Integration of the Shan"
 mr_siam_burma_6_desc: "The Shan are a rowdy and unruly people indeed- always have been, and ultimately, they're just not worth oppressing.\n\nTheir land only really holds value to us in relation to Burma, and so, if we are to maintain territorial cohesion in the region- it'll probably do us good to grant the Shan some concessions, if only to keep them from turning on us- perhaps in time this tolerance will even give fruit"

 mr_siam_burma_7_title: "The Burmese Conquest"
 mr_siam_burma_7_desc: "The day dawns where a grand chapter of our history comes to a definitive close, and thus opens a new one; one where the entirety of Burma and all its environs pay their taxes to us without question, one where Thai officials rule directly over their lands, and one where a painting of our Emperor hangs over the hearths of every home from Bago, to Ava, to the Shan Hills and from there to Arakan, and everywhere in between. In time, Burma will be naught but another province in our resplendent Empire"

 mr_siam_china_1_title: "The Mong Mao Border"
 mr_siam_china_1_desc: "The Kingdom of Mong Mao was a long lived polity that in its heyday rivalled even the likes of the old Pagan Kingdom in power and affluence, it had achieved complete dominance over the Burmese north and had even managed to penetrate into lands that have long been considered to be parts of China's core. While the Kingdom is no longer relevant in today's world, it did nonetheless prove that China is not quite the unbreakable monolith that it oft presents itself to be. If they can do it; so can we, and if we can do it; perhaps the rest of China- and all its riches- can also be within our reach" 

 mr_siam_china_2_title: "The Maitreyan Empire"
 mr_siam_china_2_desc: "A cult of paranoid eschatologists has taken hold over what once was a land of faith.\nCrippling fears of impending doom and the Maitreya's coming wreak havok in the minds of the Chinese, all propped and propagated by the most foul heresiarchs of the Song court- who rule through nothing but lies and manipulation, in their fear of being deposed. We cannot stand idly and watch as such vile scams are being played on the minds and souls of so many millions of innocents- the Song must be opposed, and they must be punished"

 mr_siam_china_3_title: "Challenge the Dragon"
 mr_siam_china_3_desc: "For their myriads of transgressions, the powerhungry leeches of the Chinese courts have not nearly been punished enough. If we are to annihilate this blatant heathenry that transpires up there, then we must move in ourselves and take the reins of China for ourselves. Piece by piece, if need be, order will nonetheless be restored to the Middle Kingdom"

 mr_siam_china_4_title: "The Siamese Emperor"
 mr_siam_china_4_desc: "Tomorrow, the Sun in China will from the South- as we move in to finalise what our ancestors started, and seized the entirety of the Middle Kingdom in our name- the excuses for why we did what we did may well have varied over the many years of these continuous wars, but the ultimate truth of the matter is that we now stand stronger than we ever have in passed- we have supplanted milennia of tradition, and we are ready to replace it all with traditions of our own.\n\nWe have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to our new Empire; and at long last, China will soon be whole again" 

 mr_siam_nusantara_1_title: "Upgrading the Thai Fleet"
 mr_siam_nusantara_1_desc: "Maintaining an arsenal of ships with which one can protect their coast from seaborne threats is only logical when conducting statecraft- building a fleet able to project one's power far, far beyond their coast however, takes effort, devotion, and ambition. If we are to throw our weight beyond Indochina and the mainland, we'll need a fleet powerful enough to protect and reinforce our mighty armies"

 mr_siam_nusantara_2_title: "Influence in Pattani"
 mr_siam_nusantara_2_desc: "Pattani is a small, albeit influential polity to our direct south in the Malay peninsula- as successors and inheritors of the ancient Langkasuka, they hold themselves on a high pedestal indeed. It is a pedestal, however, that we intend on knocking over; and subsequently sending the Pattani crashing down. We'll pick up the pieces, and add yet another piece to the ever-illustrious mosaic that is our growing Empire"

 mr_siam_nusantara_3_title: "Subjugation of Malaya"
 mr_siam_nusantara_3_desc: "At the very tip of the Malay peninsula lie the regions of Melaka and Johor, profitable, populated, and in tight control over the flow of Moluccan spices to India and beyond. While the influence of Islam in the region is to cause upheaval upon our arrival- we still deem the conquest of these regions a worthy enough endeavor to undertake"

 mr_siam_nusantara_4_title: "Across the Strait"
 mr_siam_nusantara_4_desc: "Heart and soul of the old Srivijaya; Lords of Nusantara, Sumatra is an island of historical as well as economic importance to southeastern Asia as a whole. Seizing its core for ourselves will not only allow us to strengthen our stranglehold over the straits of Malacca, but it'll also let us tap into the legacy of the Srivijaya, and provide us with most apt justification for further conquests in the Nusantara"

 mr_siam_nusantara_5_title: "The Mountains of Sumatra"
 mr_siam_nusantara_5_desc: "We may have already taken over most of what matters in the island of Sumatra, but for the sake of rendering our authority over the island absolute- we'll have to cross the mountains at the island's center and move to dispose of the petty Kingdoms and Lordships on the other side. Besides that, there's also a gold mine ripe for the taking that may prove to be of worth to us there"

 mr_siam_nusantara_6_title: "Approach the Sunda"
 mr_siam_nusantara_6_desc: "The Lords of Java in Sunda are quite the powerful adversaries indeed. Presiding over Nusantara's arguably richest and most populous island- it would be fair to argue that in their power and their hubris; they've grown fat and complacent. It is time we relieve them of their duties, then, and asserted ourselves as lords of Java in their stead"

 mr_siam_nusantara_7_title: "Lord of Nusantara"
 mr_siam_nusantara_7_desc: "We may have proven ourselves to be masters of Java and Sumatra, but to be able to extend our reign to the lands beyond we will first need to prove ourselves the masters of this archipelago's very waters- To build an imposing fleet to navigate and patrol its narrow straits, and a merchant navy which will see to it that all the region's goods are sold by Siamese traders, at home and abroad"

 mr_siam_navy_1_title: "Fleet for the Merchants"
 mr_siam_navy_1_desck: "Distinct from a war fleet but just about as crucial to a state's prosperity are the fleets that its merchant classes maintain. Tasked with bringing foreign wealth to the nation's shores, it's important that we placate the merchant classes with sizable donations to those- enough for them to fly our flags, operate under our laws, and bring gold and jewels to our coffers"

 mr_siam_navy_2_title: "A New Naval Tradition"
 mr_siam_navy_2_desc: "In entrusting the maintenance of our navies to local guilds and the merchant classes, we may in the past have saved quite a few tonnes of gold, but ever-increasingly, in this modern day of sail- not having permanent state-owned and state-maintained fleets; at the government's sole beck and call is a detriment to our aspirations of naval hegemony.\n\nBy opening state-run naval academies and standardising impressment procedures, we can come closer to an enviable standard of naval professionalism, once which will see the prestige of our navy soar to new heights"

 mr_siam_navy_3_title: "Masters of the Sea"
 mr_siam_navy_3_desc: "With reputable naval institutions and with many a man eager to enlist; the Royal Navy has in recent years reached heights it had never before seen in its history as an institution. Already among the largest in Asia, it is only logical for us to further lean in on that, and in consolidating our thalassocracy; make it the largest, vastest, and most powerful navy in the entirety of the Continent"

 mr_ifat_eth_1b_desc: "The Aussa live in one of the most challenging environments possible. The deserts of the Assab and Raya create a society that requires conflict in the form of raiding and roaming attacks in order to survive. So, we must ensure that there is no longer this need. We shall improve road networks within the region, expand coastal agriculture and improve trade networks in order to ensure these raids never happen again."
 mr_ifat_eth_3_title: "Rise of the Walashama"
 mr_ifat_eth_3_desc: "Ever since the great struggle against the Zagwe, we have fallen into a steep decline. While we were destined to dominate the region, we now can barely manage our own vassals. We must ensure that our dynasty is known and honored across all of the Amhara lands, with no one to challenge us."
 mr_ifat_eth_4_title: "The Zeila Empire"
 mr_ifat_eth_4_desc: "From Zeila, we shall become the successors to Aksum that we were always meant to be. We shall bring them into the light of Islam through kind words and sharp iron. Al Habash shall be united!"
 mr_ifat_eth_5_title: "Conquest of the Sidamo"
 mr_ifat_eth_5_desc: "The southern kingdoms are a powerful entity. They are traditionalists, worshiping neither the Christian or Muslim God. They instead follow the common beliefs of the people, and that has granted them significant power. We shall defeat them with Allah on our side, and shall destroy them utterly!"
 mr_ifat_eth_6_title: "Conversion of Al-Habasha"
 mr_ifat_eth_6_desc: "With all the different faiths of our realm, we must ensure that they are not allowed to remain as a thorn in our side. We shall convert these people to the true faith, and unify our realm more concretely"
 mr_ifat_nubia_1_title: "Defeat the Nubian Hosts"
 mr_ifat_nubia_1_desc: "The Nubian tribes and cities are broken. Alodia’s collapse has left a vacuum where a true power should be. This has led to raids into core Habesha territory as far as the Semien Mountains, giving our people much to grieve over. We can fill that vacancy of order and stability with our own rule, and protect our new citizens."
 mr_ifat_nubia_2_title: "The Saharan Passage"
 mr_ifat_nubia_2_desc: "The Funj Sultanate, a growing power in the east, has threatened us for the last time. We shall put it down, as well as the tribes of the Daju and the Tunjur. They cannot continue to harass our settlers, we must manage them appropriately!"
 mr_ifat_nubia_3_title: "Into the West"
 mr_ifat_nubia_3_desc: "Beyond the Saharan passages lies the lands of Kanem, a powerful Empire. We have attempted peaceful communication, and we have attempted to send our scholars and learned men to trade with them both knowledge and scripture. But to our shock and horror - they were followers of the most horrid Hafizi tradition! We cannot allow this to spread to the lands of the west, we must root out this heresy from its home in this far western land!"
 mr_ifat_nubia_4_title: "War with Makuria"
 mr_ifat_nubia_4_desc: "While the Makurians might have survived their bouts with the Fatimids, we are not the same. They will crumble before us, and their holy citadel of Qasr Ibrim shall fall into our hands."
 mr_ifat_nubia_5_title: "Overthrow the Fatimids"
 mr_ifat_nubia_5_desc: "The Fatimid Caliphs, barely even an actual power, lie in some of the most plentiful and bountiful lands of all Alkebulan. Yet they somehow not only manage to squander this with their incompetent ruling, they also manage to follow a heretical faith of Hafizi while claiming the title bestowed to only the most holy of men. They must be taught their place, and it is under our heel!"
 mr_ifat_tall_1_title: "The City of Harar"
 mr_ifat_tall_1_desc: "The city of saints and the home of Aw Abadir, this is one of the most important settlements in all of Ifat. We cannot let it fall into disrepair, and must expand its administrative capabilities."
 mr_ifat_tall_2_title: "The City of Zeila"
 mr_ifat_tall_2_desc: "Zeila has been the home of the Dir clan for centuries. Their powerbase in the region is immense, and should we wish to maintain their loyalty in our state, we shall grant them this boon by expanding their holdings in this port town."
 mr_ifat_tall_3_title: "A Modern Capital"
 mr_ifat_tall_3_desc: "Between Harar and Zeila, their populations have been bursting at the seams. We must decide as to where to settle our court within."
 mr_ifat_tall_4_title: "Ifati Market Towns"
 mr_ifat_tall_4_desc: "The major metropolitan centers of our Empire have a rather lacking trading business. Despite our location, much of the mercantile trade happens on the coast. If we can establish centers inland, they could be further protected from bandits and pirates."
 mr_ifat_tall_5_title: "Expand Coffee Plantations"
 mr_ifat_tall_5_desc: "The secret from the far south - this delightful delectable has been deemed by our Sufi ministers as not heretical after much debate. As such, we shall spread this good as far and wide as we can!"
 mr_ifat_tall_6_title: "Gold Mines of Ethiopia"
 mr_ifat_tall_6_desc: "In the provinces of Damot and Kaffa, gold is the primary commodity produced. We shall expand upon these mines and establish mints within the region."
 mr_ifat_tall_7_title: "African Gold Empire"
 mr_ifat_tall_7_desc: "All across the African Continent, we face heavy competition from both Malian gold and Reisland Gold. We need to combat this with our own production, and dwarf them both!" 
 mr_ifat_tall_8_title: "Monopoly on Coffee"
 mr_ifat_tall_8_desc: "No where else in the world can produce coffee as high quality and as high quantity as we do. We must ensure this by seizing any remaining plantations within Arabia."
 mr_ifat_arab_1_title: "Prepare the Ports"
 mr_ifat_arab_1_desc: "With the loss of Tajura in the Aussa revolt, the ports became damaged and mothballed. We must rebuild them if we are to expand our power into regions across the seas."
 mr_ifat_arab_2_title: "Return to Yemen"
 mr_ifat_arab_2_desc: "Our family lineage traces itself back to the lands of Yemen and the holy cities itself. Interestingly enough, after our family’s departure, a great war has erupted across that land. The Mahdi, Rassid, and Zurai are all at each other’s throats, leaving the title of Sultan of Yemen open for the taking."
 mr_ifat_arab_3_title: "Crush the Rassids"
 mr_ifat_arab_3_desc: "The Rassids are the last remaining hold out among the Yemen rebels. We cannot allow them to remain alive!"
 mr_ifat_arab_4_title: "Custodians of the Holy City"
 mr_ifat_arab_4_desc: "The most Holy of Cities is within the Sharifate of Hejaz’s hands. This is a travesty - they are barely fit for the task. We must relieve them of their duty - even should they resist!"
 mr_ifat_arab_5_title: "Continue to Hardamut"
 mr_ifat_arab_5_desc: "Along the southern coast of the Hardamut, the people are a mercantile group. They hold immense sway over the trade that we could instead have ourselves. We are already in the region - why not go further?"
 mr_ifat_arab_6_title: "Advance on Mahra"
 mr_ifat_arab_6_desc: "As we approach around the bend - we can see our goal in sight. All we have to do is defeat the last vestiges of Hadramaut will we be free to challenge our true foe - the Jabrids."
 mr_ifat_arab_8_title: "The New Sharifate"
 mr_ifat_arab_8_desc: "With the Hejaz Sharifate collapsing in upon itself, we shall assume their position as rightful owners and custodians of the holy city. We shall liberate it from their shiite hands and instead place it under loyal faithful Sunni Muslims nearby."
 mr_ifat_arab_9_title: "Challenge the Jabrids"
 mr_ifat_arab_9_desc: "The Jabrids of Bahrayn are our final foe should we wish to control all of the Arabian Peninsula. We must crush them on both land and sea, push forward to their capital in Qatif and drive them from their cities. They shall not see the light of day before we finish our mighty struggle!"
 mr_ifat_som_1_title: "Somali Warring Clans"
 mr_ifat_som_1_desc: "While the clans toil away in constant warfare and struggle, we shall sweep through them and defeat them completely. While our state is primarily made up of Harari and Aggroba peoples, we do have a strong Somali population in Zeila who would wish to see the downfall of their foes in the Horn of Africa."
 mr_ifat_som_2_title: "Claim the Ogadeen"
 mr_ifat_som_2_desc: "The deserts of the Ogadeen are inhospitable to most - but not to the Darod. They are a resilient bunch, who can take even the most brutal of environments and weather conditions in stride.\n\nHow will they deal with blades and cavalry charging upon them, I wonder?"
 mr_ifat_som_3_title: "Secure the Berbera Coast"
 mr_ifat_som_3_desc: "With our ambitions known, we shall quickly push east and seize the coastline. Here, the most valuable cities and lands are found, and we shall make them ours!"
 mr_ifat_som_4_title: "Annihilate Ajuuraan"
 mr_ifat_som_4_desc: "The Imamate cannot last much longer. As our forces crowd around the decaying remains of their state, their supplies are running short. Their men are fleeing into the bush to escape the bloodshed. It is just a matter of time before the great walls of Merca fall, and the soldiers of Al Habash flood in, taking it all…"
 mr_ifat_som_5_title: "Sweep up the Swahili Cities"
 mr_ifat_som_5_desc: "The coastal cities of the Swahili are disunited. They lack any central leadership, and can be easily dominated in one fell swoop."
 mr_ifat_som_6_title: "Into Madagascar"
 mr_ifat_som_6_desc: "A bay of pirates, warlords, and regal queens and kings. Truly, they have it all on this massive island. We shall take it for ourselves!"
 mr_ifat_som_7_title: "From Coast to Coast"
 mr_ifat_som_7_desc: "From the coasts of the wide Indian Ocean to the bed of the long Malawi Lake, we shall own all of these southern lands. While they are the stomping grounds of the Zimbabwe empire, even they cannot slow our expansion."
 mr_ifat_som_8_title: "Dethrone Zimbabwe"
 mr_ifat_som_8_desc: "Zimbabwe is the last threat to us on this side of the continent. While they were once a mighty empire, they are now nothing more than a shadow of their former glory. We shall put them out of their misery, and take their gold mines for ourselves."
 mr_ifat_som_9_title: "The Gulf of Aden Ports"
 mr_ifat_som_9_desc: "The cities of Berbera and Basaso are key cities along the Red Sea Trade Routes. In order to maintain a powerful trade influence in the region, these cities must be developed even further than they are now."
 mr_ifat_india_1_title: "The Deccan Trade Station"
 mr_ifat_india_1_desc: "Throughout the Deccan, foreign powers are establishing trade centers. Why should we be the last ones to the party? Our trade comes from that region anyways with the spices we push further north, so we should seek to take further control of that resource."
 mr_ifat_india_2_title: "Expand the Indian Colony"
 mr_ifat_india_2_desc: "Our colony is progressing…slowly. We have not received the return on investment we would have liked by this point. Perhaps we should take a more direct approach?"
 mr_ifat_india_3_title: "Masters of the Deccan Coast"
 mr_ifat_india_3_desc: "As we command more and more of the valuable trade moving south, we find ourselves in communication with the Malabar Christians of the far south. They align themselves with us as, in their eyes, people of the book are far better than these pagan worshipers. Either way, our expansion shall continue unimpeded until we are the sole power along the coast!"
 mr_ifat_india_4_title: "Conquer the Gujarat Plains"
 mr_ifat_india_4_desc: "The Gujarati plains hold powerful warriors and rajas alike. We must be careful as we expand - we should learn their tactics, and adopt them for ourselves if we must."

 cms_harvest_season_title: "Harvest Season"
 cms_harvest_season_desc: "Autumn is coming to an end, and with it the villagers bring the bounty of our free land into both their pantries and into the communal stockpile. There's a chill in the air though. A small thought, an instinct seems to have overtaken all of us and our Juiz ponders...soon enough everything will change, and we must be ready for whatever fate has in store. For now though we celebrate and party to this years hardwork. Saude!"
 cms_trinity_church_title: "The opening of Trinity Church"
 cms_trinity_church_desc: "For years we lacked a central church, but that has come to an end. Thanks to donations and volunteering from Mistelos, the aptly named Igreja da Trindade has been opened. This new structure will fullfill the spiritual needs of our peasantry. As well as serving as a rallying point and public spot for other communal uses, if need be. "
 cms_militia_commander_title: "Elect a Militia Commander"
 cms_militia_commander_desc: "Altough every peasant in couto misto is highly encouraged to own weapons and defend their own land and homes, we are in dire need of military leadership of some sort. The time has come for the peasants to come together and elect one of us to become field commander and lead the peasantry against any who dares to oppress us."
 cms_portuguese_cavaleiro_title: "Invite a Cavaleiro"
 cms_portuguese_cavaleiro_desc: "Portugal has made great advancements in war, and none is as impressive as their Cavaleiros. We'll invite one to come to Couto Misto and teach us, so that we might improve our militia. Only issue will be stopping the peasants from throwing rocks and insults at the noble born cavaleiro. Maybe offer a ham to each family as long as they swear to behave themselves...yes that works. Who doesn't like ham? "
 cms_peasant_family_connections_title: "Extended Peasant Ties"
 cms_peasant_family_connections_desc: "It's no secret that peasant families are often quite large. Being so large means that many of our own families have ties, either of blood or marriage, to other peasant families and groups spread across northwestern Iberia. We should make use of these ties to better assert our independence and spread our way of life."
 cms_basque_investment_title: "Basque Investments"
 cms_basque_investment_desc: "No realm in Iberia has become as rich as that of Navarra. The basque people are overflowing with gold, either from their goods production or from the rising profits of whaling. We could never compete with them economically, but perhaps we could strike a deal with a independent minded merchant. Guns and weapons from couto misto in exchange for a steady supply of iron, perhaps?"

It is when every peasant in our realm gathers together, and through popular voting we decide the focus of our resources. This year however will be special, we'll gather all of the peasantry inside the Trinity Church. Our Juiz will seat in a raised platform at the center of the church, moderating the debates and counting the votes, while below and surrounding him in a circle, will be the entire peasantry.

 #Galician Missions#
 gal_rebellious_son_title: "Our Rebellious Son"
 gal_rebellious_son_desc: "There was a time when the Portuguese kingdom was but a mere duchy, subservient to the crown of Galicia and Leon. That was until the rebellious son of Queen Tareixa de León, Dom Afonso Henriques declared independence for his duchy. Much has changed since those times, the line of Borgoña still rules Portugal, while we have shed away from noble control. We must end the animosity between our realms, either by diplomacy or through war. "
 gal_cement_our_independence_title: "Cement our Independence"
 gal_cement_our_independence_desc: "The Leonese-Castilian civil war has given us a unique window of opportunity to once again assert our independence. Perhaps it would be wise to choose a side to aid, surely then whoever we support would be in our debt and respect our right for self determination, right?"
 gal_papal_connection_title: "Papal Connections"
 gal_papal_connection_desc: "There's no denying the influence and importance that Santiago (and Galicia by extension) has in the catholic world. Whatever may come, the bishop of Santiago will always remain an important figure both domestically and abroad. We shall make use of his religious influence and nudge the Holy See to give us the support we so rightfully deserve from our position."
 gal_renovate_santiago_title: "Renovate Santiago"
 gal_renovate_santiago_desc: "The grand cathedral of Santiago de Compostela is our greatest pride and joy. It is the beating heart of galicia, and as such we must make sure that it always reflects the splendor of our realm. We shall renovate it and make it grander than any other pilgrim destination in the christian world."
 gal_burgo_economic_oversight_title: "Dominance of the Burgos"
 gal_burgo_economic_oversight_desc: "No other group has risen to prominence in Galicia as quickly as the urban Burgos. Our economy is all but dominated by these rich merchants and craftsmen, however this doesn't need to be a bad thing. The burgos are exceptional and talented, by giving them key positions in financial matter of our government we will reap the economic rewards, while also making sure our Bishop is untroubled and untempted by the corrupting alure of gold. "
 gal_burgo_markets_title: " Burgo Street Markets"
 gal_burgo_markets_desc: "The burgo have started an initiative of popular street markets and fairs. Once a week, our city streets are flooded with various stalls and tents of merchants, farmers, peasants and craftsmen. All competing with one another trying to sell their goods to visitors, pilgrims and city natives. These weekly markets have caused an explosion of city growth and revenue, as now even peasants from the countryside flood the city, to spend the day searching for bargains and an oportunity to better their life."
 gal_militia_exercises_title: "Muster the Militias"
 gal_militia_exercises_desc: "When we achieved independence, we did so with the diplomatic power and influence of the bishop, and the resources and funding of the burgos. One of the conditions of our coexistence, is that the matters of the army are left up to the burgos control. As such instead of relying on a levy or feudal army, the burgos have organized our defense through a system of communal militias and volunteer groups. All we can do is call upon the militias, but where they go and what they do for the realms defense, will be up to the burgos."
 gal_sell_army_commision_title: "Sell Army Commisions"
 gal_sell_army_commision_desc: "Sensing yet another opportunity to make a proffit, it seems the burgos have begun to sell off the position of commander and military officers to the highest bidder. Leading the ranks of the peasant and urban militias are now either wealhty merchants seeking to make a name for themselves, or embittered nobles looking to regain any semblance of relevance or control in our realm. Surely, this can only end well."
 gal_autonomous_communities_title: "Autonomous Communities"
 gal_autonomous_communities_desc: "Back when we were a kingdom, Galicia was dotted with various autonomous communities in both cities and in rural villages. Indeed the burgos themselves came to power through these autonomous cities. Now though by Burgo decree almost every city and village is autonomous and independent. Some faraway villages in mountains and valleys are perhaps a bit...too independent. We must bring these communities back to heel and remind them that altough autonomous they are still galician!"
 gal_la_coruna_title: "A Coruña"
 gal_la_coruna_desc: "There is no disputing that Santiago is the heart of Galicia, but if it is the heart, then the Coruña is fast becoming the brain. Settled by the coast, this once small city has recently exploded in size and population, thanks to Burgo management and investment. Indeed it now even rivals even our seat of Santiago. A concerning development, or a boon to the realm we wonder."
 gal_pilgrim_trap_title: "The Pilgrim Trap"
 gal_pilgrim_trap_desc: "We can no longer deny ourselves. The allure of gold, its too much to bear. The burgos grow so rich and powerful and what do we have? The tithe? Forget the piety, forgo your fears, for we shall grow rich too! Pilgrims flood the streets of Santiago, no, they flood the country, and they are desperate for salvation and enlightment! We shall give it to them...for a price of course. Sell relics, tax the pilgrims, sell indulgences and divorce papers, put toll booths every step of the way, give them everything and take everything from them. Oh the gold, the gold! Lord forgive me...wait, I can just buy myself an indulgence!"

#Navarra Missions#
 nav_galicias_son_title: "The Son of Galicia"
 nav_galicias_son_desc: "The Portuguese Kingdom has been led for almost 300 years by the House of Bourgone. This house has enjoyed a stable and clear line of sucession all the way since the Kingdom's founder "Dom Afonso Henriques I". Now however, for the first time in their history Portugal has no heir. The aging King Francisco de Borgonha only has a daughter, whom he refuses to declare as his heir on the grounds of tradition. We must take advantage of this, we will convince King Francisco to marry off his daughter to one of our cousins."
 nav_tame_fanatics_title: "Tame the Fanatics"
 nav_tame_fanatics_desc: "Now that we have dynastic control over the realm of Portugal, the time has come to pull the favors over our cousin and properly integrate Portugal into our cadre of vassals, same as Aragon and Catalonia. The fanatical armies of the Portuguese will serve us nicely in our effort towards unifying all of Iberia under a common banner."
 nav_to_santiago_title: "On the way to Santiago"
 nav_to_santiago_desc: "A union with Leon and a war with the emerging kingdom of Portugal left Galicia as a humbled vassal, until fairly recently. With the wealth of the city peasants, the burgos, and the influence of the Bishop of Santiago, Galicia has become independent again. The wealthy burgos have near complete control over the economy and the army but the bishop is not fully toothless (at least not in spirit). We will send the bishop an offer, if he accepts to become our vassal we will use our armies to crush the burgo militias and in exchange give full control over the realm of Galicia to the bishop."
 nav_asturian_legacy_title: "The Asturian Legacy"
 nav_asturian_legacy_desc: "Iberian Christendom was once united under the Kingdom of Asturias, but those times are gone. Now christian fights against christian, brother against brother and this couldn't be exemplified better than in the rivalry of Leon and Castile. Both fight and dream over holding hegemony in Iberia, a dream that is dashed by each other's continued existence. We will break up this senseless brotherly infighting, either they will both stand down peacefully, or we will march and force them to stop. Regardless, once this is done we alone will hold the legacy of Asturias. For there can be only one."
 nav_covadonga_title: "The Court of Covadonga"
 nav_covadonga_desc: "Once more Christian Iberia is unified, but not all our subjects are pleased. Grievances, feuds and rivalries continue to flare up and we need to give them an outlet for peaceful resolution. We will establish in the village of Covadonga a great legal court. This permanent court will be tasked with handling high profile cases between our realms and vassals. From now on, any disagreement in Iberia will be solved in the court and not in the battlefield."
 nav_court_hopping_title: "Iberian Courier Service"
 nav_court_hopping_desc: "Iberia is rather large, and considering the autonomy that our vassals hold, our basque diplomats are always busy hopping from one regional court to another. This system is rather ineffecient, so instead we shall establish a new "Iberian Courier Service". An instituition of dedicated regional couriers and postmen, that together with a revamp of our main roads will be able to deliver with speed and efficiency, any manner of news, letters and information from our various vassal courts in the edges of Iberia, back towards Navarra and Olito."
 nav_prepare_levy_title: "Reform the Feudal Levy"
 nav_prepare_levy_desc: ""No,no,no...this certainly won't do." King Carlos is rather upset at the state of the nations levy. For the dream of Iberia to be achieved, we will require a major reform. Away from the traditional feudal mustering, and towards the establishment of a professional, permanent fighting force. Perhaps we could contact the captains of the Navarrese Mercenary Company and ask them for help. "As good a place to start as any, I supose.""
 nav_walls_of_navarra_title: "The Royal Palace of Olite"
 nav_walls_of_navarra_desc: "Deep within Navarra, lies the city of Olite and even deeper into it, the great palace of Olite. The Palace is the center of our realm, it is where our King resides and where the Navarran cortes are established. The castle is a mastery and example of gothic architecture, with some foreign dignatiries even regarding it as something out of a fairy tale. However as beautiful as it is, the castle is in dire need of modernized defenses. \nWe will upgrade many of the outlying structures and fortifications and when we are done, our home will not only be regarded as a fairy tale dream, but also an aggressors nightmare."
 nav_aragon_reconquista_title: "The Aragonese Reconquista"
 nav_aragon_reconquista_desc: "While we are quite content with ruling over Navarra, our vassals and subjects are not so amicable to the Iberian status quo. The nobles of Aragon in particular have petitioned the King and the Cortes multiple times for their various claims over Qurtubah and Balansiya to be pressed. While normally they would have been rejected, it seems that King Carlo's recent...awakening of ambition, has led to a passionate speech before the cortes, with the King lending his support for the Aragonese. Already the newly reformed armies are being prepared, and deployed for the reconquista of Valencia by Aragon."
 nav_unleash_fanatics_title: "Unleash the Portuguese"
 nav_unleash_fanatics_desc: "No kingdom in Iberia is quite as zealous and fanatical as the Portuguese. The mere mention and thought over a holy war and conflict seems to drive them towards an insatiable bloodlust. While this could become a problem in the future for our Iberian ambitions, we are quite content and glad to simply let them loose over the Qurtubhans for now. Just to make them bleed a little bit and open their minds to more...peaceful resolutions."
 nav_show_mercy_cordoba_title: "Show mercy to Qurtubah"
 nav_show_mercy_cordoba_desc: "There is no denying the influence and strength Qurtubah holds, out of everyone in Iberia they are the only ones we would truly dare to call equals. Within the Cortes and among our vassals, there are cries and claims for us to strike them and end them for good. A war with Qurtubah would be a long, and hardous affair though. Not to mention the bad blood that would remain within Southern Iberia. \nNo, we will try another way. We will reach out for them, we will respect their customs, honor their laws and religion; and all we ask in return is for the Emir to recognize Navarra as his sovereign."
 nav_keys_of_cordoba_title: "The Keys of Qurtubah"
 nav_keys_of_cordoba_desc: "The Emir of Qurtubah met with the King of Navarra in the center of the city of Cordoba in a grand celebration. \nThe ceremony was attended by the greatest representatives from across Iberia and an audience of thousands. It started with the Emir kneeling before the King and presenting him with the keys of the city's gates. However instead of reaching for the keys, the King reached for the Emir's hand, holding both it and the keys as he pulled him upwards, and as the Emir and the King stood side by side they raised their shared handshake. Both holding onto the keys as the king yelled "Peace!" \nAfter centuries of war and devastation at last, the reconquista has ended."
 nav_secure_heir_title: "In my dream, I saw a whale"
 nav_secure_heir_desc: ""It was golden and it swam in an ocean of black water and upon the whale, was a great city with a hovering crown of iron. Wherever the whale passed, every animal and being bowed down to it, and then I heard it singing. Its name, was Iberia." \nKing Carlos has been beset by a strange vision, and a newfound obsession. He claims to the cortes, that it is Navarra's destiny to finally unite all of Iberia, to end the reconquista, to end war and misery. It will be a massive undertaking, one that will require us to be both savy diplomats, and cunning generals but Carlos claims we are capable of it, and the King always seemed to have a way with words...so be it. The hunt for the golden whale, shall begin.""
 nav_aragon_nobility_title: "Little Nobles of Aragon"
 nav_aragon_nobility_desc: "To even conceive of starting our plans for Iberia, we must first deal with the subjects that already swear fealty to us. \nThe realm of Aragon passed into our control once King Carlos grandfather, Sancho the Strong fought for his claim on the Aragonese throne, after the late James I the Crusader died in the great Cathar French Crusade. Ever since then we have consolidated the high nobles of aragon with a mix of marriages, concessions and court positions in order to secure their loyalty to their new overlords. However, we have for too long neglected the lower aragonese nobility. These regional barons, counts and even some dukes have recently started to stoke the fire of rebellion, expousing nonsensical concepts and garble like "Aragonese nationality", and "regional autonomy". We will fix this by giving these regional nobles a direct channel and outlet to the king, in order to resolve their grievances."
 nav_catalonia_merchants_title: "The Merchants of Catalonia"
 nav_catalonia_merchants_desc: "With the union over Aragon came also the union over the lands of Catalonia. A land where the sway of the nobility was almost non-existent, and instead the merchants and guilds of Barcelona were and still are king. What Barcelona decrees the rest of Catalonia follows, and what Barcelona desires above all else is gold and prosperity. \nWhile we could try to merely impose our will over the merchants, King Carlos says this would be rather inneficient and a waste of potential.\nInstead we will use the expertise of the merchants of Catalonia by employing them and hiring them as bureucrats and admnistrators in our realm. We will also give control of our finances over to them, letting them oversee the wealth and prosperity of the kingdom. This should both fullfill their monetary ambitions and provide us with a stable, and reliable financial bedrock for our Iberian dream."
 nav_bearn_clergy_title: "Bright Bearn Monks"
 nav_bearn_clergy_desc: "The vassalage of Bearn has been a very recent affair. Having occured only a few years ago, the catholic monks of Bearn requested our protection and aid in fighting against the entrenched local Waldensian heretics. It has been hardwork, as the Waldensians keep retreating further and further into secret communities in hidden caves, peaks, valleys and forests dotted all throughout the Pyrenees. \nWe must put an end to their blaspheming, by showing the Bearn clergy we are capable of stomping even the most entrenched heretic, perhaps we could convince other local southern french vassals and realms to join us. \nAfter all, the french have clearly failed in their struggle against the Cathars, and if the french can't defeat them, then we must pick up the slack." 
 nav_forward_watchposts_title: "The Gates of Iberia"
 nav_forward_watchposts_desc: "While the Pyrenees offer us an exceptional natural defensive border with the rest of Europe, we should not have to be content with it being our first line of defense. \nBy using the pretense of fighting heresy in southern france, we could move in to the Cathar heartlands of Toulouse, routing the heretics and occupying their mighty fortress of Carcassone. With it under our control we could set up various outposts along the Garonne river into Bordeaux, which would give us not just, uncontested economic control over southern france, but would also pre-empt anyone in Europe from interfering in our Iberian ambitions."
 nav_misto_peasants_title: "The Andorran Fortress"
 nav_misto_peasants_desc: "The little community of Andorra la Vieja is a strange oddity, not just in Iberia but in all of Europe. \nA realm dating back to the times of Charlemagne and whose official Head of State is a duality of both the Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia and the King of France. For a long time we have chosen to merely ignore this little independent community, but as our Iberian ambitions grow we must start to take steps to properly integrate them into our wider realm. \nWhile we could very easily do a show of force, this is rather unnecessary, not to mention mean spirited for such a small community. Instead we will offer to protect their status and autonomy in our realm, as well as giving them a place of honor by establishing the "Andorran Border Guard". A company of all Andorran serving guardsmen to patrol and protect the pyrenees against would be invaders and criminals. Just as long as they replace the French Co-Prince with a Navarran one of course."
 nav_iberian_federation_title: "The Iberian Federation"
 nav_iberian_federation_desc: "Finally, after struggle, sweat and toil all of Iberia is under our control. The time has come to convene the Cortes, invite representatives from our vassals and to finally, fullfill King Carlos dream and make Iberia a reality. \nWherever our blessed King is, we hope he can see what we have achieved and that he is proud that we have made his dream a reality."
 nav_expanded_cortes_title: "Expand the Cortes"
 nav_expanded_cortes_desc: "The growth of Iberia and the ever ongoing integration of our former vassal realms into the government apparatus, has demanded that we expand the seats on the Cortes to accomodate the various new regions that join our great Federation. On the upside of this however, the new cortes members are quite energetic and ambitious. They have seemingly filled the instituition with a newfound zeal and drive, allowing the governance of the state to be much more effective and flexible than it had been in these last couple decades."
 nav_naval_funding_title: "Naval Funding"
 nav_naval_funding_desc: "Our navy and merchant fleet is in an awful state. If we wish to go somewhere, anywhere, we need to first fix this disaster. \nWe will set up more funds for the Basque navy, for it is honestly just embarrasing we even let it come to this."
 nav_royal_nau_title: "The Royal Karrakak"
 nav_royal_nau_desc: "Our naval buildup is nearly complete, and our initial wave of marines is almost finished with their training but we are still missing a vital piece in our arsenal. We need a flagship, a great heavy command center in the ocean, that our newly constructed fleet can rally behind and follow into the darkest abyssal depths. \nWe will spare no expense, this Karrakak will be pride of our nation and with it leading our fleet we shall never be defeated in a naval battle!"
 nav_basque_marines_title: "Create the Basque Marines"
 nav_basque_marines_desc: "Our nation has no shortage of seasoned and experienced sailors. As such, one of our newly promoted admirals has come with an interesting proposal. One to tackle both the issue of our army reform and the buildup of a proper state navy. \nWe will create the Royal Basque Marines a dedicated force of elite sailors and veteran whalers who will act as the land branch of our navy. Fully able to fullfill the role of both sailor and soldier, wherever we need them."
 nav_integrate_catalonia_title: "Integrate Merchant Fleet"
 nav_integrate_catalonia_desc: "Now that we proven ourselves towards our Catalonian admnistrators and financeers, we have been able to negotiate a deal where we will be able to control and direct a portion of the Catalonian Merchant Fleet and use it for whatever goals the crown has in mind. Provided we pay the agreed upon subsidy, maintenance and repairs for the fleet while it's under our control...Actually, I'm starting to think we got scammed."
 nav_redirect_trade_title: "Redirect Trade to Barcelona"
 nav_redirect_trade_desc: "With the Catalonians becoming an ever increasingly important part of our government, we have found ourselves seeing their own ambitions as ours. \nAmong these Catalonian ambitions is that to control the flow of trade and riches from the mediterranean. While we aren't exactly in a position to control the wealth from Italy or Greece, we can focus our efforts towards the trade that flows into Seville and relocate the terminus towards Barcelona instead."
 nav_mozarabic_nautics_title: "Moor Sail Developments"
 nav_mozarabic_nautics_desc: "With the control and integration of Cordoba, has also come the various innovations and research that had been conducted by the muslims. Among the most promissing of all the inventions that have come out from the University of Seville has been the Moor Sail, a triangular canvas that once attached to a small or medium sized vessel, allows it unimaginable amounts of control and maneuverability over the winds. \nThis sail has the potential to enable a vessel to reliably venture into the farthest depths of the ocean and return alive! We must take use of this innovations immediatly, and fund greater developments to fit it into larger hull ships."
 nav_a_new_world_title: "A Whole New World"
 nav_a_new_world_desc: "In seaside taverns and docks, rumors and stories spread. Seasoned sailors and whalers tell stories of faraway lands across the sea, of verdant islands and cyan colored waters, of massive bounties of fish, of strange crying birds and strangers with odd vestments and languages. Already these long tales have captured the imagination of our people, and hundreds brave out into the sea to find these fabled paradises. Perhaps, just, perhaps it could be worth it to look into an investigation of our own."
 nav_terranova_title: "Terranova"
 nav_bay_of_plenty_title: "Settle the Bay of Plenty"
 nav_bay_of_plenty_desc:"The tales were true. Across the sea in a land we have called the bay of plenty, lies a stretch of ocean filled with unimaginable amounts of fish and, whales. We must establish outposts immediately, the riches of the sea lie just within our grasp!"
 nav_eel_lair_title: "The Eeel's lair"
 nav_eel_lair_desc: "A most peculiar discovery has been made by one of our whaler vessels. While on a journey from the Bay of Plenty towards the Azores, the ship travelled through an area of the Atlantic we call the "Sargassos Sea" and on it, just barely below the surface waters, a truly hellish picture revealed itself to the crew. Hundreds, no, thousands of young eels dotted the water. There were so many infact, the captain claimed the sea was more eel than it was water. Since the encounter, fishermen together with students from the University of Seville have been sent to witness the strange phenomenon and have determined that this portion of the ocean is the birthplace of every eel in the world. We must take advantage of this discovery and monopolize the eel trade."
 nav_hellish_paradise_title: "Hellish Paradise"
 nav_hellish_paradise_desc: "The Central Reisland Isles are a true paradise. Cyan colored warm water breaks against pristine soft sands, exotic and delicious sweet fruit trees grow in abundance everywhere, and the warm clear sky welcomes us everyday with a comforting glow. \nOne would truly think it a paradise, were it not for the constant sound of the cracking whips, the cries of our plantation workers and the neverending suffering and toil that the cashcrops have brought to this land. Our clergy says it's abhorrent, unchristian and that we will be judged by God for allowing such suffering to befall on our lands but the truth is, these plantations bring us quite a large degree of wealth. \nPerhaps it would be best to limit acess to this, hellish paradise, keep our whalers, our clergy and anyone else except for the planters, the slavers and workers from being able to dock into the isles. Out of sight out of mind, they will be much happier not knowing where their cotton, tobacco, coffee or sugar comes from."
 nav_even_further_beyond_title: "To go even further beyond!"
 nav_even_further_beyond_desc: "We have come far from the Bay of Bizkaya, we have evolved from the mountainous Kingdom of Navarra, to a true Iberian Federation, to a grand global empire. Now we must push ourselves further. This, is to go, even further beyond!"
 nav_blue_whale_hunting_title: "A Kindred Kingdom"
 nav_blue_whale_hunting_desc: "The occean currents and winds have brought us to a strange land, but with a familiar people. The Kingdom of Hawaii is remarkable and in many aspects, very much like our own. The native hawaiian people are expert seamen, navigators and shipwrights, indeed we must admit our own whalers and marines have created a sort of affinity and kinship with these people. We must reach out for the Hawaiin king and convince him to join our great federation. We would be honored to have such a kindred kingdom, and sail brothers withint our ranks."
 nav_orca_hunting_title: "Frontier of Reality"
 nav_orca_hunting_desc: "Our people are pioneers like no other. Our whalers know no bounds, as they chase the prized whales to every corner of the world, and into the frontier of reality itself. Although the riches always find their way back to our ports, we must admit our grip and control over the farthest frontiers is quite loose. This has somehow become appealing to some within our realm, as an influx of freedom seeking adventurers now flood out into the frontier, often disappearing from the settlements into the wilds, and off of reality itself (As far as we are concerned)."
 nav_sperm_whale_hunting_title: "A World of Whaling"
 nav_sperm_whale_hunting_desc: "From the Bay of Bizkaya, to the Bay of Plenty. From frozen Greenland, to stormy Anti-Atlas. From distant Taiwan, to even further Aotearoa. We have chased the great whale over every region and wave of this great world. Empires may claim dominion over each other and their lands, but for us, our dominion is that of the water. For wherever is a whale, there is a basque.\nThrough determination, courage and bravery we have tamed the ocean, and turned it into a whalers world."
 nav_world_class_mariners_title: "World Class Mariners"
 nav_world_class_mariners_desc: "The Royal Basque Marines have become the most prestigious and feared branch of our entire military. Renowed for their hardyness, discipline and organization, it seems that every young boy in Iberia dreams of one day joining the Royal Basque Marines and go on adventures across the sea. \nWe shouldn't have to shatter their dreams, we have restricted promissing young men from joining the Marine Ranks for far too long. We shall open up positions to any Iberian and transfrom the Royal Basque Marines, into the Federal Iberian Marines."
 nav_abyss_stared_back_title: "The Abyss Stared Back"
 nav_abyss_stared_back_desc: "We have gone too far. The abyss has stared back."
 nav_coastal_fish_markets_title: "Coastal Fish Markets"
 nav_coastal_fish_markets_desc: "The Coast of Navarra is home to a multitude of fishing and whaling communities. That, combined with our fishermen's ability to traverse the Bay of Biskaya and enter into French and Castillian markets gives our peasantry the opportunity to grow rather rich. \nWe will incentivize this economy even further by sponsoring the opening of dedicated marketplaces in these coastal towns, for the sale and trading of the bounties of the sea."
 nav_whalers_of_bizkaia_title: " The Whalers of Bizkaia"
 nav_whalers_of_bizkaia_desc: "When it comes to whaling, navarra is the best in the entire world, but the best of the best hail from Bizkaia. The bizkaia whalers are legendary for their prowess, effeciency and bravery. \nOnce a whale is spotted by the permanent town watchmen, the bell is rung and the bizkaia whalers rush to their sloops where they then chase the whale until their prize is caught. It is an art to itself of dedication and determination. We will invest in this community and build it up so it can become the true whaling hub from where all of our projects for whaling expeditions and ventures can depart from."
 nav_integrate_whalers_title: "Whalers into Marines"
 nav_integrate_whalers_desc: "Whalers are the best of our society. Brave, resourceful, and unflinching. Veteran whalers will make the perfect candidates for our Marine program. \nWe will open it up to any basque whaler that no longer wishes to engage in the whale hunt, and would rather be on a steady payroll. We will also open the program for any whaler that is too old or potentially retired, as even the valuable experience of these seasoned seamen can be put to use on training and teaching new volunteers."
 nav_dominate_bay_of_biscay_title: "Dominate the Bay of Bizkaia"
 nav_dominate_bay_of_biscay_desc: "For a long time we have rivalled the french over control for the trade that flows from and into the Bay of Bizkaia. The french merchants try to pull it towards their port city of Bordeaux, while we pull it towards Bizkaia. \nThis back and forth needs to end permanently, for any sort of faraway venture we have planned will be useless, if in the home stretch the merchants simply choose to go to Bordeaux instead. We will put all of our effort into eclipsing the french economic influence and at last, the Bay of Bizkaia shall remain, Bizkaia."
 nav_arctic_whaling_title: "Arctic Whaling Expeditions"
 nav_atlantic_whaling_outposts_title: "Atlantic Outposts"
 nav_atlantic_whaling_outposts_desc: "The discovery of the Azores Archipelago has completely changed the dynamic of our economy, and massively increased the range of our whaling expeditions. These islands sitting right in the middle of the atlantic are the perfect hub, almost as if sent by God himself so that we may tame and capture the great titans of the sea. \nNeedless to say that we will build them up, the Azores will be outfitted with state of the art docks, shipwrights and whaling stations, we will turn it into a proper atlantic service station and from here we shall launch a great whaler empire."
 nav_follow_pods_north_title: "Follow the Pods north"
 nav_follow_pods_north_desc: "For a long time the prime whaling region for our whalers was the North Sea and the Coast of Norway and Iceland. Naturally, we have sent expeditions directly north to see what we might find and we have not been disapointed. \nThe far north is home to a vast population of various species ranging from belugas, humpback's and even the ever illusive narwhal. We have also rediscovered the lost island of Greenland, a desolate land of legend that we have only heard in stories from Icelandic fishermen and it is indeed as empty and hostile as they claimed it to. The perfect place to set up a penal colony whaling station!"
 nav_follow_pods_south_title: "Follow the Pods south"
 nav_follow_pods_south_desc: "With the success of the northern expeditions the next logical step was to send expeditions south. We followed the african coast, meeting along the way the various prosperous kingdoms of West Africa and were quite impressed to see they had developed their own version of the Moor Sail. After some preliminary trading we heard from their own initial mapping efforts of various islands dotted allong the Southern Atlantic. \nSuffice it to say, we must race for them and claim them before they have a chance to do so!"
 nav_the_vasconian_lane_title: "The Vasconian Lane"
 nav_the_vasconian_lane_desc: "While we have no shortage of manpower when it comes to our whaling ventures and outposts, the same cannot be said from our other overseas investments. Various Iberian merchants have started companies and projects to take advantage of the fertile overseas lands, and sponsor the creation of cashcrops to be sold back in europe. However they haven't been able to atract Iberian workers to these plantations, owing to the nature of the work, the distance from home and the quality of the pay. A portuguese merchant however has proposed a novel solution, by contacting the Mali Empire we could tap into their monopoly over the African Slave Trade and buy slaves to work on the plantations."
 nav_antarctic_fishing_title: "The Docks of Anti-Atlas"
 nav_antarctic_fishing_desc: "Our whaling efforts seem to propell us to ever exciting frontiers. The latest one being the discovery of the southern tip of Africa. \nConsidering it's position our sailors have taken to call this rocky and mountainous cape as "Anti-Atlas" as a reference to the faraway Morrocan Atlas Mountains visible from Gibraltar. While this southern african cape is quite treacherous and dangerous, it's honestly quite nothing for seasoned and experienced Basque sailors raised in the Bay of Bizkaia. A lesser maritime culture would have quite an issue with it, probably naming it something silly like "Cape of Torments", but we aren't quite as dramatic. Cape of Anti-Atlas will do just fine." 
 nav_nautical_pioneers_title: "Nautical Pioneers"
 nav_nautical_pioneers_desc: "While we may have come late into the theater of Naval Exploration, there is no denying that our whalers, our marines and our brave admirals have been at hard at work bringing Iberia to the forefront of naval developments. We have struggled against the waves and winds, and even now we have fully dedicated ourselves, our nations very spirit towards becoming true Naval Pioneers."
 nav_basque_ocean_title: "The Basque Ocean"
 nav_basque_ocean_desc: "Our trading ventures and our mastery of the ocean currents and the wind have enabled us to truly call the Atlantic Ocean as our own. Sure, other empires may sail and build their own empires on either coastline, but once they spot our whaling and trade ships venturing against the storms they avoid, they know who this ocean truly belongs to. This is no longer the Atlantic Ocean, this is the Basque Ocean."
 nav_invest_in_whale_processing_title: "Invest in Processing"
 nav_invest_in_whale_processing_desc: "Long before our mastery over the pyrenees, Navarra was already known and famed for the quality of our iron works and smiths. As we continue to grow and expand we must not forget about this essential cornerstone of Basque economy, we must continue to invest and fund more workshops, forges and other processing facilities to refine the various ores and minerals we extract from the mountains. Only with a solid iron foundation can our realm truly prosper and resist whatever the future throws at us."
 nav_industrialize_economy_title: "Industrialize our Economy"
 nav_industrialize_economy_desc: "As the proffits of our whaling continue to grow, so do the various processing methods and industro-mechanic advancements. Be it through either savy flencers in our whaling docks, or industrious students in the university of seville, new and efficient methods of processing are being discovered and deployed all over our realm. The potential that this industrialization of our economy could bring is unimaginable, even possibly allowing our already growing whaling economy to truly skyrocket and make us even richer than our wildest dreams. The golden whale is finally within our sight."
 nav_global_whale_oil_monopoly_title: "The Basque Oil Monopoly"
 nav_global_whale_oil_monopoly_desc: "There is no words to describe our splendor. Everywhere we look, everywhere we go, no one can match our prosperity, our wealth. \nWe have grown richer than any other realm, any other empire in the history of mankind itself and we haven't even begun to peak yet. Everyday that passes, the demand for our oil increases, machines beat and hum to fuel the world's empires and they clamor and beg for our oil. In the future, gold shall become worthless, for as industry takes over the world so too shall the demand for our oil to fuel and fund it. For as long as we hold the source of the world's engines under our control, we shall be the masters of it. \nThe oil must flow."
 nav_deep_sea_expeditions_title: "Deep Sea Expeditions"
 nav_deep_sea_expeditions_desc: "Sometimes our whalers have chased their prizes far off into the deep ocean. While a dangerous venture, the reward almost always makes up for it and in the event where they are able to return, these intrepid whalers talk about virgin islands sitting quietly among the waves of the atlantic. \nSafe to say people always took these tall tales with a grain of salt, but as our whalers become more bold and new advances are made in the field of sailing, perhaps it wouldn't be a bad a idea to check on these suposed mythical islands."

 nav_federal_fleet_title: "The Federal Fleet"
 nav_federal_fleet_desc: "Now that we hold Iberia under our control, the time has come to upgrade our navy to reflect out status. For we no longer need a navy capable of projecting power over just Iberia, we now need a navy capable of projecting power into Europe and perhaps the world itself. \nWe will need to acess our vassal's navy, requisition whatever our admirals deem apt and decommision any old tub that is no longer fit for this new age we are bravely sailing into together."
 nav_foreign_fleetmen_title: "Foreign Fleetmen"
 nav_foreign_fleetmen_desc: "To properly maintain our ever growing navy and merchant fleet we don't only need marines, we need proper deckhands, more sailors and fleetmen. While we have been only exclusively hiring basques to man our navy, now that we have established the Iberian Federation and it's fleet there's no reason why we can't hire other Iberians to serve in it. \nWe will also open up positions of auxiliary ship fleetmen to foreigners and non-iberians, and after a set service of years aboard a ship, they will be given citizenship and the right to live in our federation."
 nav_professional_marine_force_title: "Professional Marines"
 nav_professional_marine_force_desc: "As our navy and its manpower grows, the functions of the Royal Basque Marines have been diminished, which has allowed us to truly turn the marines into a feared, organized and proffesional force. However we need more, we need to train the marines further. \nWe won't stop until the marines are able to breathe under the ocean itself!"
 nav_native_fur_trade_title: "Native Fur Trade"
 nav_native_fur_trade_desc: "As our new world whaling outposts grow, so do our meetings with the various tribes and inhabitants of these new strange lands. Their reactions to us are varied, sometimes hostile, sometimes friendly, but in the more positive outcomes it seems that some of our whalers and members of their families in the outposts have begun to engage in trading with these tribals. They offer us various foodstuffs, crafted goods but most importantly, furs. \nWhile the economic benefit of this fur trade is negligible when compared to our whaling ventures, it is a nice bonus and extra economic activity for idle workers in whaling stations. We will not hinder this native trade, If they won't harm us, we won't harm them."
 nav_state_travelers_title: "State Travellers"
 nav_state_travelers_desc: "Wheter spurned on by wanderlust, greed, or merely the wish for adventure, it seems that our youngmen are abandoning the whaling stations and leaving with native traders back into the inner wilds of the new world. Sometimes these adventurers come back, dressed in native clothing, and even more shockingly, accompanied by native wives and possibly even offspring. They bring us back wares made by the native tribes that they know our whaling stations need or would find useful, and they make a killing selling it to us, their own people! \nThese "Forest Runners" as our whalers have come to call them, are quickly outpacing and syphoning our youth away from their whaling jobs. For some reason it seems the thought of living away from society in the woods with some tribesmen, is appealing to them. \nWell we'll make our own trade monopoly! We shall invest in our own "Forest Runners" called "Forest Travellers", state sponsored workers to explicitly go into the woods and establish trade routes and deals with these native tribes for their goods, in order to dislodge the forest runners influence and tribal trade monopoly."
 nav_south_grazing_title: "Colonial Frontier Caches"
 nav_south_grazing_desc: "As we continue to expand our whaling outposts and fishing settlements, we find ourselves ever farther away from Iberia. As such, the issue of colonial supply has started to rear its head. The pampas in Southern Reisland is perhaps the solution to this problem. The land is fertile and vast, if properly tamed we could organize its agricultural output into "Frontier Caches", pre-emptive supplies that will be dropped on various islands, beaches and frontier regions. These frontier caches with their tools, and foodstuffs will enable even the most inept and inexperienced settler to survive, and perhaps even thrive, in the far off frontier."
 nav_indian_toll_title: "Indian Ocean Toll"
 nav_indian_toll_desc: "With the establishment of the Anti-Atlas shipyards, the maritime route towards rich India is now open to us. More exctingly however is the discovery of various uninhabited islands in the Indian ocean. While we never really set out with expectations to create a vast trading empire, our string of whaling outposts and stations could be easily turned and fitted with proper areas for merchants and traders. \nEven if it's not as profitable as the whale trade, perhaps it wouldn't be a bad idea to encourage our merchants to venture into india, we could even offer them support with our navy. By patrolling the Indian ocean we could make our merchants job easier, by establishing an indian ocean toll, where every merchants has to pay our ships for the right of passage in the indian ocean, while our own merchants would be exempt."
 nav_maritime_commisars_title: "Naval Commisars"
 nav_maritime_commisars_desc: "It seems that the expansion of our Marine forces has led to somewhat of a dillution in the discipline of the forces. Even worse, the Marines have developed an attitude of superiority and elitism towards their fellow shipmates and countrymen. This is a problem, not only for ship morale but also to the image and prestige of the marine force that we have strived so hard to cultivate. \nLuckily, this can be easily fixed. We will create an additional officer spot to oversee the marines, the "Naval Commisars". These aged veteran whalers, and retired captains will be given the sole authority to punish and rear any marine that strays too far from the proper attitude of a gentleman and representative of the Federations most prestigious military role. The marines will be disciplined, through any means the Commisar deams necessary."

From our home deep in western europe, the whales have guided us here to the rich and mythical lands of China. \nLong had we wondered if the legends were true, and now that we are here everything seems to still be far greater than anything we could have dreamed off. We must take advantage of our positions and bring the rich and rare chinese goods back to europe...and to the north, it seems we met our match. The Japanese seem just as apt, just as determined and just as profficient at whaling as we are. \nBest keep an eye on them, before they can grow too ambitious and contest our monopoly."
 nav_pampas_cornucopia_title: "The Pampas Cornucopia"
 nav_pampas_cornucopia_desc: "In Southern Reisland lies a region we have taken to call "The Pampas". This region of relative flatland is not only vast but also incredibly fertile and sparsely populated by natives, making it ideal, nay, perfect to encourage immigration and settling of farmers. \nIf we are able to properly sponsor and establish an agricultural union in this land, we would not only have all of our potential food supply issues taken care of forever, we could also become a worlwide supplier of food and grain, perhaps even more productive than Egypt, Sicily or even the Blue Horde. \nWe must not let this workhorse of agriculture go away, or be taken over by anyone else, send the travellers immediately!"
 nav_global_network_title: "A Global Network"
 nav_global_network_desc: "Our great federation knowns no bounds! All across Reisland, settlements boom and prosper. \nAll thanks to the vast interconnected network of supplies and logistics that we have created for ourselves. This has benefitted Iberia propper itself as well of course, and who knows. Maybe one day the Reisland colonies will be civilized and tamed enough that we will be able to add them to our great Federation. A global federation perhaps?"
 nav_euskal_bakea_title: "Euskal Bakea"
 nav_euskal_bakea_desc: "The Basque Peace. It is how our chroniclers and historians have begun to refer to this grand period of peace that we find ourselves in. In every corner of Iberia, to faraway colonies in Reisland, to even farther whaling stations in Asia. Everyone in our great federation basks in the glory and prosperity that we have brought. Iberia is secure, and the trade lanes flow with gold, luxury goods and supplies from Reisland, truly this peace is what all true warriors strive for."

mr_greece_unity_1_title: "Prepare for the Campaigns"
mr_greece_unity_1_desc: "To reunite the ruined lands of Rhomania, will be no easy feat. Yet it must be done, for one cannot deny the prestige, splendor and strategic worth that this ancient ravaged land still holds."
mr_greece_unity_2_title: "The Latin North"
mr_greece_unity_2_desc: "For far too long, the story of Greece was one of unrest and turmoil caused by the disonnance of the religion of the ruler and the ruled. This needs to end, both the people and the crown must follow the same doctrine, there is no other way."
mr_greece_unity_3_title: "Connecting the Cities"
mr_greece_unity_3_desc: "Though we may have lost the old cosmopolitan glory of the Empire, not all that surrounds us is desolation. Yes we are diminished, but a few cities and settlements still survive.\nIt should be our upmost priority to connect and safeguard the roads to these settlements, to springboard our economic rebirth."
mr_greece_unity_4_title: "The Hellenic South"
mr_greece_unity_4_desc: "The birthplace of Hellenic culture and hundreds of civilizations that left their mark on history. To control southern greece is essential for any that wishes the glory of uniting Rhomania.\nJust please mind the ruins when marching through it."
mr_greece_unity_5_title: "Populating the Pindus"
mr_greece_unity_5_desc: "The desolation of Rhomania could present us with a unique opportunity to rebuild this land how we best see fit. By investing and encouraging peoples to settle, and by building new state of the art defenses we can lay the foundations for a civilization that may one day outlive any other before us."
mr_greece_unity_6_title: "The Rebirth of Rhomania"
mr_greece_unity_6_desc: "Time and time again we have been battered, brought to the brink of complete obliteration and yet, we survived.\nRhomania is reborn once more, out of the ashes of destruction, we are eternal."
mr_greece_unity_7_title: "Rebuild the Arsenal"
mr_greece_unity_7_desc: "Hellas has always been first and foremost a naval land. The Aegean sea is as much our home as the hills and mountains, and if we wish to unite Greece we must have a navy that would be the envy of Argos himself."
mr_greece_unity_8_title: "Reclaiming the Aegean"
mr_greece_unity_8_desc: "The true soul of greece lies still in the islands of the Aegean. For it is the islands that the desolation spared the most, and if we truly wish to unite hellas, we must secure them.\nSail onwards! Fear no Circe."
mr_greece_unity_9_title: "A New Naval Theorem"
mr_greece_unity_9_desc: "We have learn many things from the Imperial fall, but one of them was how utterly lacking the navy had become. We must course correct this, we must solidify our naval structure and doctrine into something capable of mastering the golden horn."
mr_greece_speciality_1_title: "Retrain the Guard"
mr_greece_speciality_1_desc: "Scattered throughout all of greece are a strange people.\nA People from the far north, vicious, unrelenting and almost barbaric.\nYes the descendants of the Varangians still stalk our lands, without direction they have become especially adept thieves and robbers, but we can change that.\nWe will hire them, give them purpose and turn them once more into the formidable fighting force they were always meant to be."
mr_greek_build_first_title: "Restore Trade Links"
mr_greek_build_first_desc: "Greece is a land of many ports and a deep maritime tradition, situated in a most-crucial corner of the mediterranean- able to establish a most strict chokehold over European trade, and control the flow of Asian goods with great ease.\n\nYet for all its potential, years of neglect, war, and famine have left these ports and entrepots underutilised- and the world's merchants consider these lands as nothing but a minor stop in the midst of greater destinations. We curb on these obtuse ideas, and work in rebuild our cities and our towns- doing what's necessarily in refacilitating Greece as a proper trade hegemony." 
mr_greek_build_second_title: "Rebuild the Lost Citadel"
mr_greek_build_second_desc: "What remains of Constantine's great city; rubble, ruins, and a couple decrepit towers, are all painful reminders of what a cruel hand history has dealt us. From meteors, to the second coming of Attila; few can ever believe that the measly fishing town that now lays there used to be the world's largest, and most resplendent city.\n\nWe must begin a long process, and rebuild that great City from the ground up- starting with a new set of great walls, and in getting people to live behind them."
mr_greek_build_third_title: "Invent in the Market"
mr_greek_build_third_desc: "With our help; our once-great City has climbed from the precipice of oblivion has made itself a proper, upstanding town- worthy of living in.\n\nMerely 'worthy of living in' however, does not befit its status of the Queen of Cities, and as such- there much more work to do in restoring it. This time; our advisors suggest we focus on its local production, their idea was focusing on the lucrative Glass industry- but beyond that; Constantinople of old was also famous for the likes of its well-forged swords and armors, its rich and fine Silks, and its intricate and eloquent Jewelry. In this, we are rather limited- and can't be everywhere all at once, but we believe ourselves able of restoring one of these great industries, at the very least." 
mr_greek_build_fourth_title: "The World's Desire"
mr_greek_build_fourth_desc: "'Nenikika se, Solomon', or, 'I have surpassed thee, Solomon'- are said to be words uttered by Emperor Justinian upon first entering the Basilica of the Holy Wisdom- The magnum opus of Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles. Now, after the Mongols, what remains of this once great cathedral are parts of its entrance, its foundations, its bell tower, and an odd yet-standing wall here and there. What happened to it is a tragedy through and through- but, with what we have, we hope we can rebuild it- perhaps even to match the likes of the marvel that Justinian himself laid eyes upon, long ago.\n\nRight next to it also sat the Great Hall at Magnaura; once the judiciary and legal center of the Roman Empire- in restoring the Holy Wisdom, it'd also be wise to bring that back as well, and properly restoring the City's Roman glory."
mr_greek_build_fifth_title: "Manage State Finances"
mr_greek_build_fifth_desc: "In restoring Greece and bringing back its long-lost prosperity, one must keep his finances in check, lest he worry about loans and bankruptcy in the midst of a restoration project.\n\nWe must secure steady sources of income, be rid any debts we may have, and expand the administrative cadre- in order to fill our coffers and finance our future endeavors." 
mr_greek_build_sixth_title: "Expand Farm Production"
mr_greek_build_sixth_desc: "While Greece if not all that good for farming- Olives are great for Greece; being among the few crops able to sufficiently grow in any capacity in our mountains and our valleys, the Greek homeland has always been one of the biggest producers of Olives and Olive oil in the known world. That is rather fortunate; for it turns out olives, outside of Greece, are in rather short supply. We ought to standardise and expand on our state-owned olive groves, then- to give our merchants more product to sell at steep prices, and a subsantial supply of lucrative goods for us to selectively export to our allies and our accolades, should it ever benefit us." 
mr_greek_build_seventh_title: "Control the Flow of Goods"
mr_greek_build_seventh_desc: "While the trade in and around Constantinople is sufficiently under our grasp, the flow into it, in contrast; is not. If one of our rivals wishes to tap into our monopolies and cut us out- they'd be well able to, by reaching the markets of the Bosphorus, the Levant, and Egypt through other means. It is imperative, then, that we establish a strong presence in crucial chokepoints- and make our trade fleets an ever-present sight across the Eastern Mediterranean."
mr_greek_build_eighth_title: "Expand Olive Oil Contracts"
mr_greek_build_eighth_desc: "Our olive groves are vast and yet expanding, but they are not standardised- and that in of itself is hurting us, and brings down the full potential of these facilities. We'd do well to regulate the production and distribution of our groves, and standardise their output across the board. In monetarily incentivising our groves to increase production, it'd also be wise to increase our exports- and see our farmers well and truly rewarded for their efforts."
mr_greece_border_1_title: "Secure the Hills of Skopje"
mr_greece_border_1_desc: "Skoupoi- Skopje, is an inland city due north of Thessalonica, with it and its surrounding borderlands controlled in recent history by the petty lords of Velbazhd. It's not worth much in of itself; but what it opens up in Serbia and Bulgaria is well worth the effort we put in conquering it for ourselves."
mr_greece_border_2_title: "End the Bulgar Khans"
mr_greece_border_2_desc: "An ever-present thorn on our side, the Bulgars and their delusions of grandeur have time and time again led to multiple protracted conflicts between them and our people- we have, indeed, decisively won most of those aforementioned conflicts, but that fact has seldom ever gotten to through to them.\n\nIt's time we teach them once again, and this time make sure the message sticks"
mr_greece_border_3_title: "Push to Tirgoviste"
mr_greece_border_3_desc: "Barely even a logging town amidst vast tracts of forest just a few centuries ago, the Vlachs due north of the Danube have carved a civilisation for themselves out of seemingly nothing. It's not much, but it's of worth to us- if we wish to keep the horselords of the Pannonian basin in check."
mr_greece_border_4_title: "Aid the Albanian Revolt"
mr_greece_border_4_desc: "Greek in all but spoken language, the Albanians north of Epirus have always had close cultural ties to us. In liberating the Greeks from outside influences, perhaps, liberating a people that has historically been friendly to us too would also do us plenty good. In providing us with soldiers eager to fight for our cause, and in deepening our already rich cultural ties."
mr_greece_border_5_title: "Challenge the Serbian Empire"
mr_greece_border_5_desc: "Ever the petulant fraudsters, the Serbs think that merely winning a war and conquering land makes them eligible of having an Empire.\n\n Empires, beacons of civilisation, are not- in fact- flimsy conglomerates of barbarous peoples, ruled in villages by tribal chiefs- as the Serbs may define the word.\n\nIt is our duty, then, to challenge the very notion of a Serbian 'Empire'- to barge in their towns and cities and humble them for good."
mr_greece_border_6_title: "Hegemon of the Balkans"
mr_greece_border_6_desc: "The home of the Greeks, of Rome, and thousands of years' worth of history and civilisation- the Balkan Peninsula is a grandiose place, one that brings with it some of the world's most opulent jewels. We must consolidate it all in the name of our nation, and in doing so, bringing the rest of it up to par with its ever-so-glorious southernmost promontory."

#Thracia
mr_thracia_first_title: "Fortify Istinople"
mr_thracia_first_desc: "Oh how the mighty have fallen. Where once a city worthy of comandeering an Empire that stretched all the way from the southern tip of Iberia to the springs from which Mesopotamia's twin rivers flows stood, now nothing more than a fishing hamlet ruled by a half Greek half Latin merchant family with lofty dreams remains. Still, its strategic importance of being one of the two European cities with a direct sightline of the Marmara straits has never left it.\nBy ensuring we are on the good side of the §Y[CST.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]§! and lull their delutional ambitions back to sleep their eventual reintegration within our state aparatus will go ever so smoother, while also enticing them to fight just a bit harder for us during their time left with their little city-state."
mr_thracia_second_title: "Defense of Marmara"
mr_thracia_second_desc: "With our supply lines passing through [151.GetName] secured, we can now focus on a most immediate problem: the Turks... or more so the possibility that they might try to attack us while we are busy elsewhere, just as they subsumed what was left of the Greek Empire in Nicaea. The ancient fortress of §Y[316.GetName]§! stands as our last stronghold in Anatolia, while §Y[4779.GetName]§! ensures that anyone who tries to bypass it will have to suffer yet. It is time we reciprocate the love that they show us every waking hour by shielding us from any Anatolian menace, and refurbish them to a condition that will make anyone wielding the sword of war think twice before approaching."
mr_thracia_third_title: "The Latin Revenge"
mr_thracia_third_desc: "The vile warband of §Y[4704.GetName]§! foolishly pretends that they are safe, to think that their past sins would be forgiven with the passage of time. How naive of their khans to be so absentminded, having forgotten all about the people they condemned to the afterlife before their ordained time. It is time for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to remind them. Go, make way for Deliverance!"

#Corinth
mr_corinth_first_title: "Strengthen the League"
mr_corinth_first_desc: "We stand at the gates of prosperity, armed with knowledge of the past; and the keys to the future. If we are to well and truly make good use of all that we have, we must first make sure to keep good hold of we have so far achieved; Our glorious league- a true of symbol of Peloponnesian unity against the turbulence of the Latin world, is an outwardly strong one.\n\nIn our complacency of years' past, however, we have come to realise that maybe- just maybe- our two colleagues don't quite trust us as much as we'd like them to. It might in part be due to our earlier attempts at conquering them outright, before settling for a league- but focusing on the details is the killer of the bigger picture. What matters now is that we work towards bringing our league together, and making sure any grievances our allies may hold against us are dead and buried."
mr_corinth_second_title: "Unify the Koinon"
mr_corinth_second_desc: "In bringing unity to Greece; we must rise to the occasion, and prove ourselves worthy of taking center-stage. Within our league, we must do what we can to dwarf our colleagues- and to increase their reliance upon us and our protection. The word, here, can indeed prove mightier than the sword."
mr_corinth_third_title: "To Koinon Sympheron"
mr_corinth_third_desc: "In working towards the common good we ought to show our friends just how much they stand to benefit from Corinthian leadership, in serving under an advanced, modern, strong, flexible, resolute government; that holds them and their lands as priorities number one on its agenda. In uniting the Peloponnese, we must enrich it first."

#Thessaly/Thessalonica
mr_thessal_one_title: "A House Divided"
mr_thessal_one_desc: "Following the misfortune of our father Reginald's failed attempts at restoring order in Rhomania, the kingdom of Thessalonika's authority was weaked to the point that it split between his two sons upon his death. May he rest ever peacefully, for now his offsprings have to pick up the pieces and restore order to the split up kingdom. May the best brother win!"
mr_thessal_two_title: "End the Anarchy"
mr_thessal_two_desc: "Back when we acted upon God's will and ended the decadent Empire, our ancestor §YBoniface I, former Marquis of Montferrat§!, was supposed to inherit the throne of Eastern Rome, remaking it into a proper Latin Empire. Alas, the schemes of the greedy Venetians did not let it pass, instead enthroning the weak willed §YBaldwin of Flanders§! as the Emperor of Constantinople. With that, Boniface had to settle for the then imperial co-capital, [148.GetName].\n\nThe sins of Baldwin finally caught up to them in the 1260s when the hooligan known as Hulagu absolutely decimated the city they so greedily clung to. Years passed, and Boniface's heirs bid their time, until the Latin throne laid claimed by a child after a Bulgar raid. Sadly, it was not yet the time, and for our rashness we suffered.\n\nBy now, we've learnt our lessons, and shall not make the same mistake twice. When we take our birthright, no one shall be able to stop fate."
mr_thessal_three_title: "The Knights of Christendom"
mr_thessal_three_desc: "As we continue to consolidate and expand, more and more men of ability flock to our righteous banner, eager to ride towards victory. By cultivating a culture of excellence among all of our cavalrymen, holding them to a standard as high as that of a noble knight, inducting them into the various military holy orders pledging allegiance to us, and treating them as nothing less than brothers in arms, regardless of their background, we could turn them into such an effective fighting force that would make even the most fierce of steppe lords cower in fear. The holy fire of Christendom shall be expected to be carried among their hearts, each setting an example for the rest in virtue of sanctified combat."

#Arta
mr_arta_first_title: "The Twin Cities"
mr_arta_first_desc: "When one, in colloquial Greek, wishes to allude to 'everything in excess'; they say 'Arta and Ioannina'- a testament to the vast wealth that these two great cities within our realm have accumulated over the years. Sharing between them boundless books of knowledge, intellectuals, weaponsmiths, silversmiths, and all of Constantinople's remaining wealth.\n\nWhile it true that these two cities do not quite enjoy the presence of the other; they also are the sole notable cities within our domain- for beyond their environs in Epirus proper and Aetolia lie vast tracks of nothing; of swamp, forest, rustic village and jagged mountain. We must enrich our two cities, and do what we can to bring them closer than they have ever been."
mr_arta_second_title: "The Kingdom of the Pindus"
mr_arta_second_desc: "The Backbone of Greece; the Pindus is a mountainrange that- at the same time- has proven our lives difficult, yet has also possible. It's in this place we've been at our most free as a people, yet it's also this place that's historically been the hardest to control. We must bring the mountainslopes on every side under our banner, and do what we can to appease the mountainlords of the disparate villages throughout- and ensuring their loyalty to the Crown. Then; with Epirus and all surrounds it well and truly under our control, we can proclaim a Kingdom to rival the likes of the Latin thieves and vagabonds of the due east."
mr_arta_third_title: "Align the Albanian Tribes"
mr_arta_third_desc: "Cultural exchange between the Greeks and the Albanians has, of course, been at its strongest at the border; in Epirus. With the line where one's majority starts and ends being a difficult one to draw- as Greek villages can be found at the remotest reaches of Albania, and Albanian villages likewise can be seen as far south as the Gulf of Corinth itself. Our government and their tribes have been a constant thorn at eachother's side for many a century now, and if we are to truly move past that as nation- those tribes; we must control. We must ensure their loyalty, codify their rights in law, but also their limitations."

#Cephalonia and Corfu
mr_epirus_first_title: "The Catalan Campaign"
mr_epirus_first_desc:  "Here's a painful truth; the lands we hold at this very moment are pretty much worthless- trade with Italy being the sole thing that keeps our dominion yet-afloat. Beyond our island's coast however lies a land well worth seizing, beyond our coast also lies a rival principality; having kept hold of an island just about as worthless as ours. If we can consolidate our domain, even just a little bit, and secure a stream of income to hire a foreign army- we'll perhaps be able to then strike true at the mainland, and then carve a proper state for ourselves."
mr_epirus_second_title: "Reclaiming Epirus"
mr_epirus_second_desc: "It was the people of Corfu that in antiquity gave Epirus its name; 'Vast', 'Infinite', for it reached out and extended far beyond what one could see. Now too does Epirus hold an undoubtable level of prestige over us; its mighty twin cities being among the very richest in the entirety of Greece, and its mighty mountains keeping it safe from any and all threats from the east.\n\nWe must tap into this, and claim the region for ourselves; as our ancestors once did, before being driven out." 
mr_epirus_third_title: "A Company of Heroes"
mr_epirus_third_desc: "The Catalan mercenaries that we've kept in our employ have been an invaluable asset of our Kingdom's arsenal; and the very key that led to its previous triumphs. Their guard is one we ought to expand, to glorify, and to pay better than anyone else in the market. If we're able to secure their loyalty through that, perhaps then we'll be able to also integrate them further to our state, and in turn grant us Europe's foremost professional army!"

#Athens
mr_athens_first_title: "Overthrow the Triarchs"
mr_athens_first_desc: "While we might for the time being be safe from the whims of the Thessalonican kings, having recently broken free from them, there still is a large threat looming over us. With the three baronies of [3003.GetName] under Venetian dominion, they have a jumping point to reimpose their slimy authority all over the Greek lands once more. To combat this, we should try our hand at a little underhanded diplomacy to secure the island for ourselves. Even if we fail in convincing the Venetians to hand it over without a single drop of blood, it will still convince the rest of the world that our claim is just."
mr_athens_second_title: "The Old Institutions"
mr_athens_second_desc: "Regardless of how much the old greek empire continued to decay, there was one thing it continued to have until the end: well codified institutions. With a new wave of bureaucratic reform sweeping across Europe, we have a chance to look over the institutions of old, and adopt them within our legal system, solidifying the state, while also putting the minds of our citizens at ease that they once again live under a proper legal system."
mr_athens_third_title: "Athens Resurgent"
mr_athens_third_desc: "When we took over [146.GetName], it was nothing more than an average settlement, far removed from the reputation it has for its ancient history. The only thing it really had going for it was the pilgrimage site it has in its old §YParthenon§!, a former pagan temple turnt Christian church in the 5th century, dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Under our guiding hand we've managed to revive the ancient capital of the Greek world, not only economically but also politically, as echoes of the renowned Athenian democracy still resound within the minds of the educated."

mr_CST_first_title: "Approach a Natural Ally"
mr_CST_first_desc: "Across the pond from the remains of our Megalopolis lies a peculiar tribe; strong, yet fragile- The Ottomans, we can be fairly sure that they come pretty close to us when it comes to hating the Thracians and their dominance over the region. Perhaps, we can approach them with an idea; in helping us rid them of one of their strongest rivals, and securing in their stead a friend."
mr_CST_second_title: "Invite Turkish Soldiers"
mr_CST_second_desc: "We can smell blood in these waters; the Thracians are weak- and their soldiers weary. We must get ready to strike while this still lasts, and let our Turkish allies know what we're about to do."
mr_CST_third_title: "Pierce into the Latins"
mr_CST_third_desc: "The time has come, tonight; we strike with all that we have, and bring due vengeance at the door of the vile Frankish miscreats, who've so benefitted at Rome's expense. It is due time we remind them why Rome came to rule the Ecumene, why Rome came to seize the world's riches, and why Rome is eternal. Constantinople may be little more than ashes; yet her indomitable spirit perseveres, and it thirsts for vengeance." 
mr_CST_fourth_title: "Align the Patriarchs"
mr_CST_fourth_desc: "In the many years of Rome's most tragic absence from its very home; its most faithful have been led astray- trying to found and raise their own churches and their own episcopates to fill the gap of our absence in their hearts.\n\nThis will no longer be necessary.\n\nWe will bring the disparate churches of Greece to heel, and we'll remind them all who the ultimate authority on this Earth is; who Heaven's spitting mirror image in the land of the living is supposed to be, and who it is God trusts most with perpetuating His will and His divine plan. Obviously; not them- that would be us."
mr_CST_fifth_title: "The Byzantine Resurgance"
mr_CST_fifth_desc: "The Roman Empire may be in part, back, thanks- of course- to us. But, there many things that need to be done still before we can claim its mighty namesake and assume its holy mantle. Greece, the Imperial Core; must be all brought under our banner, and the Ecumenical Patriarchate- Rome's last surviving institution; must be strengthened, and its primacy of old must become a reality anew. With that, a dark chapter in this glorious land's history can end for good, and a new epoch of glory can earnestly begin."

#Latins
mr_greek_latin_first_title: "Secure the Aegean"
mr_greek_latin_first_desc: "With the mainland of the empire secured, it is high time we finally turn our eyes to the second piece of the puzzle: Anatolia. Once the homeland of countless Greeks, the eastern half of the Byzantine whole, it's been overrun by Turkish sultans. So long as the western Anatolian coast is not secured, their boats will have an easy time harassing our shores, and one wrong move would even allow them to cross over to Europe, which we absolutely can not allow."
mr_greek_latin_second_title: "Challenge the Rum Sultans"
mr_greek_latin_second_desc: "The so called "Rum" sultans are nothing more than pretenders to Rhomania, leeching off the fact that Anatolia used to be inhabited by Greeks, known as Romans to them, before their arrival. Asia Minor is not big enough for two Romaniaes."
mr_greek_latin_third_title: "The Faithful of Anatolia"
mr_greek_latin_third_desc: "With the Seljuk invasion, the Christian community in Anatolia all but crumbled to dust with time. Regardless of if they were bowing to the lower patriarch of Constantinople instead of the prime Pope in Rome, by virtue of us retaking the land, it has become our responsability to revitalize the true faith there. In empowering our clergy and soldifying our ties with the Pope further, we should be able to turn around fate and have the very people spread around God's truth without our further direct intervention."
mr_greek_latin_fifth_title: "Latinize the Turks"
mr_greek_latin_fifth_desc: "The Turks, even in defeat, pose an ever present threat to our authority. The only true way to reign them in is to bring them within the wider Christian community, undoing the lies that false prophets have deceived them with. With that, we will have solidified ourselves as a true Christian, not just Catholic, power in the region, and ensured the loyalty of the rest of the diverse Christians within our realm."
mr_greek_latin_sixth_title: "Reclaiming Asia Minor"
mr_greek_latin_sixth_desc: "With the Sultanate of "Rum" throughly humiliated, our path towards reintegrating the rest of Anatolia is all but clear. Be it Armenian or Assyrian princes, Turkish beys, Greek pirates, rogue crusaders or anyone else foolish enough to challange us shall bend the knee to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in [Root.Capital.GetName]!"

mr_greek_latin_seventh_title: "Battle for the Holy Land"
mr_greek_latin_seventh_desc: "The Holy Land is right at our doorstep. It is currently occupied by nothing more than petty lords in comparrison to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. For a safe and secure pilgrimage, we ought to take it under our tutelage."
mr_greek_catholic_first_title: "A Home for the Legate"
mr_greek_catholic_first_desc: "So far we've made little progress in garnering the favour of his excellency, The Pope, after our little expedition in the lands of the Greeks. By refurbishing our holy houses and offering adequete accomodation to our guest papal legate, the Pope's representative in our lands, we should be better equipped with swaying the Pope through the legate."
mr_greek_catholic_second_title: "Call on the Faithful"
mr_greek_catholic_second_desc: "With us finally having cleaned our reputation for, admittedly, going against the Pope's orders when sailing for Constantinople, we should look to cultivating a reputation of being the hosts of Christians who seek to prove themselves in combat."
mr_greek_catholic_third_title: "An Emissary of the Papacy"
mr_greek_catholic_third_desc: "It is not enough for us to simply be a place where Christians ready for duty congregate, we have to be the right hand of the Pope, and be ready to enact his will upon all those who dare defy him."
mr_greek_catholic_fourth_title: "Spread the True Faith"
mr_greek_catholic_fourth_desc: "For at least two centuries we've been living in the lands of Rhomania, and so far we've managed to sway an embarrasingly small amount of people to follow the successor of Saint Peter instead of that of Saint Alexander. With the papal legate finally having proper accomodation, we should be able to convert the locals to the proper Catholic way of Christianity."
mr_greek_latin_ninth_title: "Crusaders of the East"
mr_greek_latin_ninth_desc: "All of our efforts in the east will be for nothing if we don't do our mission properly, and solidify our rule by bringing the light of God to our subjects."
mr_greek_latin_eighth_title: "The Ports of Alexandria"
mr_greek_latin_eighth_desc: "After all these years, we finally have the chance to achieve the original goal of the 4th crusade, before it got derailed by Byzantine greed. With having not only the Holy Land secured but also the backing of a whole empire, it should not be too much of a challenge. To arms!"

mr_greek_orthodox_first_title: "Maintain our Diocese"
mr_greek_orthodox_first_desc: "While his All-Holiness- the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, was and always will be the very spiritual center around which Greek Orthodoxy revolves; Ecclesiastically, giving the Latin-controlled Mother-church the right of appointing bishops and administrating the free episcopates of the Orthodox is nothing but a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe Latins mustn't be allowed to control a single facet of our people's spiritual life; we must thus empower our Archepiscope and give him the legitimacy he needs to establish a proper Church of Greece, at the very least until the seat of the Patriarchate itself is liberated" 
mr_greek_orthodox_second_title: "The Slavic Communities"
mr_greek_orthodox_second_desc: "Ever since the collapse of the Roman Empire and the arrival of the Mongols, the faithful in Greece have been rendered completely cut-off from the rest of the Orthodox world- susceptible now to the slimy influences of the Antichrist's herald over in Rome.\n\nIf we want to strengthen our spiritual standing, we must reach out and establish ties with the Orthodox faithful of Kiev- and work together in countering Catholic advances in our rightful lands" 
mr_greek_orthodox_third_title: "An Eastern Brotherhood"
mr_greek_orthodox_third_desc: "With our ties to the Orthodox world rekindled, we must now make what moves are necessary to reaffirm our historic spiritual primacy over the Orthodox faithful- and expand the ecclesiastic reach of the holy Greek Church throughout our lands. If, of course, we want this to really mean anything- we'll also have to commit to our new purpose; and do what we must in protecting the proper faithful throughout the Ecumene" 
mr_greek_hellas_first_title: "Across the Ionian Sea"
mr_greek_hellas_first_desc: "Just beyond the pond from Corfu lies the land that once was called Greater Greece, or, Langovardia in more recent times. It was a land with a once-thriving Greek element to it, one that has suffered at the whims of the Latins since the 1070s.\n\nIf we are to truly claim to have liberated the Greeks from the iron fist of the Frank, we must be absolute in our conviction; and bring the fight back to them- freeing our brothers who have suffered most at their hands and teaching them a lesson they won't ever forget"
mr_greek_hellas_second_title: "Lay Claim to Rome"
mr_greek_hellas_second_desc: "From Rome began the greatest Greek Empire the world has ever seen- it is only reasonable, then, in honoring our legacy, that we'd want to bring this treasure of a city back to the fold, and treasure it as we do the very likes of Constantinople and Thessalonica themselves.\n\nIn doing that, we'll also be kicking the antichrist's child from his blood-stained throne and reclaiming his Basilica in the name of the proper faith, it is a goal well-worth striving for"
mr_greek_hellas_third_title: "Extend Magna Graecia"
mr_greek_hellas_third_desc: "Greater Greece, we argue, is a term that can very well be extended far beyond its current reach- and with Rome itself in our hands, who stands to oppose us?\n\nIf it's in Italy, it can very well be part of Greater Greece- and if it's in Greater Greece, then it's rightfully ours"
mr_greek_hellas_fourth_title: "Avenge Constantinople"
mr_greek_hellas_fourth_desc: "While we can't exactly bring down the mighty blade of vengeance upon a rock from the sky- we can instead direct it at the slimy dogs of the Venetian lagoon, and lop off their heads with it.\n\nArchitects of our misery and sleazy conspirators who feed upon the misfortune of others; nothing we can do to them can ever be enough to match what they deserve"
mr_greek_hellas_fifth_title: "End the Latinokratia"
mr_greek_hellas_fifth_desc: "With Venice gone, and the seat of the Papacy in our hands; the main actors of the Fourth Crusade have now been dealt with- but justice has not exactly been served yet. Just like how the whole of Greece was once under Latin rule; the home of the latins must now fall wholesale to Greek hands, then, and only then will we ever be even"
mr_greek_orthodox_fourth_title: "Shield of the Faithful"
mr_greek_orthodox_fourth_desc: "We did what we had to in order to regain our spiritual self-determination; our fledgling Church thrives, and its authority is disputed by few that matter.\nNow, however, is the time we protected this much-desired autonomy with our steel and our very own blood- and proved to the infidels of the world that this is our faith, and that we will do what we must in keeping it free and unchained" 
mr_greek_orthodox_fifth_title: "Establish Latin Metropolitans"
mr_greek_orthodox_fifth_desc: "As it turns out, our brethren in Italy are not quite as in-touch with their mother faith as we'd like them to be- instead having long opted to believe in the Pope and his egomaniacal cult of character that permeates the rest of the west. This can't quite do, for Greater Greece to actually be great, its religious character ought to be brought back in line"
mr_greek_orthodox_sixth_title: "Mend the Schism"
mr_greeK_orthodox_sixth_desc: "With Italy under our boot, and the Greeks of the south having had their faith retaught to them- it's only natural that in mending the troubled past of our peoples, we'll have to mend the religious divides of old as well.\n\nIn doing that, we'll have to always remember that the Latins, if anything, are all our brothers and sisters in Christ- and are not, in fact, responsible for the megalomaniacal whims of the Papacy oh-so many centuries back. In an act of charity, we'll be teaching them the true ways- our ways. Thus will the Great Schism of 1054 be mended, and our people can know peace"
mr_greek_hellas_sixth_title: "Return of the Griko"
mr_greek_hellas_sixth_desc: "The core of Greater Greece has, since last Greeks ruled there, lost much of its traditional Greek element to cultural erosion- with many of the people now living there not quite able to see themselves for what we know they are. If anything, however, we're patient; and in patience, we'll do what we can to bring these lost sheep back to the flock"

mr_greek_orthodox_fifth_a_title: "The Bogomil Threat"
mr_greek_orthodox_fifth_a_desc: "The Bogomilist heathenisms, far with-out any sensible definition of 'Christian' in what clouded lies they preach, have been a thorn on Rome's side for a long, long time. Now, that we once again find ourselves in direct contact with these misguided, illiterate plebeians; its about time we gave them their overdue comeuppances, and eradicated their schismatic cult for good- tearing down its depraved altars and driving away their heinous proselytisers, replacing them instead with houses of proper worship, and good heralds of the true faith" 
mr_greek_orthodox_sixth_a_title: "The Heart of Orthodoxy"
mr_greek_orthodox_sixth_a_desc: "The Haemus, otherwise known as the Balkans- containing the core and heart of the Roman Empire and its very crown jewel, was the land in which the proper faith was best maintained, in stark contrast to the centuries of schisms, heresies, and cults that have long since plagued the broader Christian world. Yet in the years of our guiding hand's absence; heresy of all shapes and sizes has nonetheless managed to creep in and get itself established in this pure land.\n\nIn working to correct the world, one must first keep a tidy home- and so we shall; we shall clean the house and throw out the trash, and from there we'll once again resume our sacred work"

 mr_greek_muslim_first_desc: "The coup of Alexandrios has been successful. Now the Elite of the Byzantine state are Turkish and Muslim. However, the general populace has had…less popular reactions. The people do not understand that we have found the true path, away from the lies of the Franks and ancient Romans - the prophet's word is the only way forward, and we shall show this to them through a gentle hand of persuasion and reason. The words of the Qu'ran shall bring our people into the light, and shall save the soul of this empire"

 mr_greek_muslim_second_desc: "Our reputation among the wider Muslim community is still negative. Our predecessor's history of attacking and resisting the words of the Prophet have led to many believing that we are simply faking our conversion. This could not be farther from the truth - we are genuine in our conversion, and so we must improve our standing within the international Ummah, within the communities across the world."
 
 mr_greek_muslim_third_desc:  "The Basileus woke up from a dream he had; he saw a blinding light to the south, so powerful that his hands could not block it, so strong it pierced through his shut eyelids. Then, he heard a booming voice, demanding that the Basileus leave his residence, to go on the journey. When he awoke, his mind was set. The Basileus began to prepare for his journey, shaking off his nerves and gathering funds from his personal treasury - he would travel to Mecca, he would complete the Hajj."

 mr_greek_muslim_fourth_desc: "The laws of Islam are complex and varied. Our specific teaching might have certain restrictions that others do not have. We have hired scholars and learned men to investigate the hadith and the teachings of Muhammad to aid us in this task. We need to investigate what the intent of the first generation of Muslims was, and how our Basileus can guide our people into the future."

 mr_greek_muslim_fifth_desc: "Greece has been resistant to our teachings. While it does make sense, the Basileus is the Universal Imam, his word is final on all matters spiritual and secular. They shall bend the knee and follow the true faith one way or another, but we hope they shall come into the true path of their own will, and not have to resist our truth."

 mr_greek_muslim_sixth_desc: "The light of Allah has been seen by the people of Rhomania. They now speak both Greek and Arabic in their daily lives, one for commerce and one for the mosque. They whisper prayers to Allah in their daily Salat, and work to find time to fast during the months of Ramadan. But beyond Rhomania, the people of the Balkans still find themselves following heresy and heathen traditions. We shall export our faithful there, to bring them into the warm and loving embrace of Allah."

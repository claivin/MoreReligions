 french_elective_monarchy: "French Elective Monarchy"
 french_elective_monarchy_desc: "During the Crisis of the 13th Century, repeated military failure and unstable succession saw the devolution of the French crown into an elected position. Originally suggested by lawyers and clergymen, a temporary solution of election was put forth, likely inspired by Salic Law. By 1308 Charles II formalized this process into law and the following year Robert III, Count of Flanders, was elected to be his successor, setting a precedent for the non-french rulers. Over the course of the next one and a half centuries the Church makes more and more moves to influence the election of the French King, though its influence is only as strong as people's belief in the Church is... Nevertheless, the throne of the French Kingdom remains an important battleground for influential nobility from all over Europe vying for prestige and upward mobility."

In stark contrast to its neighboring Dutch Confederation, the Frisians are making great strides in forming an unusually centralized state. Of course, there is still much work to be done before it reaches anything close to modern administration."

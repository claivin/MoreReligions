Since then the political climates and extenuating circumstances of regions the world-over have rendered the idea of a standing army unfeasible. However, growing populations, political stability, and general beaureaucratic improvements have enabled leaders to marshall organized forces. Look around us, great nations are beginning to supply and train their own soldiers, direct from their national coffers - and its effectiveness cannot be overlooked; it does not take a general to see that this is the way of the future.

These fleets often traded at their own behest, paying a small sum in taxes to the state they operated from. Recent developments in technology and the increasing prosperity around the world has allowed for the establishment of standing navies completely funded by the state. Warships requiring ever-greater numbers of cannons and arms have rendered private investment unfeasible, but the gains to be wrought from trading abroad as a state are unbounded."

 flavor_lna.lnasukwardesc:0 "Since the founding of the alliance in the period of Thammaracha the 3rd, the leaders of Lan Na have kept to themselves and made good on their promises to the southern Thai kingdom of Sukhothai. When the lord Thammaracha the 4th came to the Chang Rai, however, a situation developed. While the lord was a pious man, he often had lapses in judgement and fell to temptation. That night, he seemed to have gotten into an altercation after having drunk too much fine rice liquor, and attacked one of the guards attempting to quell the matter. Thus, the guards rightly defended themselves, and sent the king home. He died of alcohol poisoning on the journey, which greatly saddened the ruler of Lan Na, Tilokaracha. However, the upstart brat Thammaracha the 5th used it as an excuse to claim that the Mangrai dynasty must be quelled and subjugated! Thus, the ruler Tilokaracha summoned his troops and prepared for the invasion - it would not be an easy one, but the fate of his kingdom was on the line!"

Their rulers had been subservient to Ayutthaya for some time, but when the Angkor Empire invaded in 1380 and the city fell, the writing was on the wall for them. Soon, they too would be absorbed by the resurging Khmer kingdom. However, in a stroke of luck, issues to the east diverted their enemies’ attention, giving Sukhothai some time to breathe. In those precious few years, the king Thammaracha the 3rd spent much of his time working with nearby allies in Si Thammarat, Pagan, and Lan Na in the hopes of containing Angkor. While talks with Pagan fell apart, the northern and southern Thai kingdoms maintained somewhat positive relations, with Lan Na even entering an alliance with Sukhothai. However, in the year 1440, when the aging Thammaracha the 4th went to visit the Lan Na city of Chang Rai for Song Kran, he was first humiliated and then assaulted by members of Lan Na’s royal guard! There was no reason or apology given, and the beloved king died from his injuries on his way back to Sukhothai. This sparked a crisis, in which the new king Thammaracha the 5th, leapt into action, summoning levies and arming his soldiers, declaring war in 1444 to completely subjugate the enemy!"

 bunga_teratai_war.d:0 "Ananggavarman Srivijaya was placed in a tight situation, to say the least. His uncle Sri Sujavarman was a renowned Vajrayana Buddhist and when he was in power from 1378 to 1402 had attempted to convert the empire of Srivijaya to his faith. This completely and utterly failed and it only built up resentment from the local Mahayana, Theravada, and Hindu population. The king's attempts to push this on the vassals, however, was a bigger issue. Many of the more powerful subject states, which had previously been spared forced conversion, where now being demanded by the Sumatran King to convert to a foreign fath. This act strained the already rocky relationship the metropole had with its periphery. With the loss of Borneo and Malaya in the last century, Ananggavarman was seen as the successor to a line of weak kings who could not defend their own territory, and princes from Majapahit to Pasai now considered their chances of success should they attempt a rebellion. And, in 1446, this moment presented itself to them when a scandal was uncovered. Ananggavarman was estranged with his first wife since they had first wed. However, the truth behind this would not be known until she had returned to her home in Majapahit. There, she told the prince Rajasanagara that Ananggavarman would not bed her and bring about an heir - He was impotent, she cried. The prince of Majapahit took this as an insult, declaring his suzerain unfit and unworthy to rule. Rallying the lords of Pasai and Pagaarruyung to his side, they began an all out war for freedom against Srivijaya. The Bunga Teratai War had begun!"

However, it was not to stand forever. The forces of [MAJ.Monarch.GetTitle] sieged down the fort for months, until finally, a breach in the wall during a late night siege attempt gave them their opening. Close quarters fighting inside the packed barracks, brave soldiers would rush in for the Maharaja, to defend the honor of Majapahit. When the dust had settled, the enemy’s forces were in full retreat, but the cowardly garrison was quickly caught by cavalry brigades. By the time dawn rose over the misty hills, the ancient site of Borobudur was in the hands of [MAJ.Monarch.GetTitle], and many of the local residents flocked to his banners, willing to fight for a true king."

Before many of them had even been able to put on their armor, the walls had been breached. What few men remained prepared for the onslaught of soldiers, and despite however many those brave few guardsmen slew, more kept pouring in through the hole in the wall. Fighting continued for hours, as bodies piled up on each other, and the stench was just beginning to become numb to the defender’s noses. However, soon enough, the captain of the fort ordered a retreat before more lives could be lost; a smart, strategic decision. However, him and his forces were caught just outside in the jungles and were put to the sword before even given the chance to surrender. The brutality of the war continues, and Srivijaya just lost a major foothold in the fight against the usurpers."

Angkor Wat was magnificent, even by Borobodur’s lofty standards; with hundreds of hallways and rooms, thousands of statues and epitaphs, carvings, and depictions of the many sagas of bodhisattvas of days gone by, it was a glorious ode to both the Hindu and Buddhist faith. How could a holy site, as decorated and fantastical as this one, be built by such incompetent and foolish rulers as the Angkor Empire, who, despite their vast wealth and power, could hardly stand against the might of Srivijaya? And so, they proclaimed on the spot that they would instead take up the mantle of the Crown of Jasmine, ruling over the Mandalas and Kingdoms in harmony and with temperment, a glorious empire that shall bring prosperity and power across the lands. When they returned to the captured royal palace in Phenom Penh, they began to properly discuss how they would administer and design this empire. One idea was to maintain the old order, the thalassocracy, by subjugating nobles and kings in cities dotting the trade lanes. This way they could bring the wealth that flows through the straights to us directly, by holding kingdoms under our sway - and should these subjects reject Srivijayan ruling, we simply remove them and place a Sumatran lord in power. However, this might produce anger from the nobles and kings we displace, and perhaps even inspire a popular revolt from those not from Nusantara. However, an advisor, an aging monk, came forth and told our ruler of another option - we instead were to focus on controlling the various inland Mandalas, projecting the strength that our faith held, we could be able to create a new empire, with righteousness and fulfillment as its core tenets. While this might infuriate the heathen lords in our vast empire, it might sway the more faithful to our side. This debate raged all night long, until at long last when the sun rose through the windows, our lord made an announcement."

However, starting with the rule of Sujavarman, the upkeep of the temple has been considerably lacking, with rulers instead favoring other public works projects instead of the old temple. Pilgrimages died down, sermons stopped being performed, and the temple has begun to decay and slide into ruin as our Maharajas ignored the growing problems.

To our ruler, this was a great deal, so they asked the administrator if they had any ideas. The advisor was a shrewd one and had already thought up a plan: If his lord were willing, he would be given the island to be controlled directly by him, and indirectly by the ruler. This way he could focus on removing the elements of instability one by one, until it was time to integrate it into the fold.

His strife with the great oligarchs of Hungary had left the kingdom fractured and disunited. Charles the I, the supposed rightful heir, had caught the Plague and died, but it was for naught either way. Many Hungarian nobles did not want the young boy to come to power. Instead the oligarchs invited Ladislaus V to rule their land - and while this united the lands of Hungary and Bohemia for a time, the king kept trying to force the Hungarian nobles to bend to his will and join the Empire, something the Hungarians had no desire to do.\n\nThe King had strife with the houses of Poland, and when he launched an invasion on the emperor himself, the houses of Aba, Kan, Czak, and Koszegi rose up in revolt and instead gave the rule to a Hungarian Nobleman by the name of Thomas Szécsényi, who was instrumental in overthrowing the Bohemian forces. The Szécsényi did not get to power alone, however - they appealed to the Polish crown and the Serbian lords, calling upon their aid to overthrow the Bohemian ownership. While Thomas died in 1332 while pushing out the Bohemian influence, his son Michael became the King of Hungary at the age of 15.\n\nAfter being placed on the throne, any attempts at centralization were crushed by the Oligarchs. Instead, a decentralized era began, where each oligarch had immense control over their own territory - during this time, the Serbians and Poles shifted their focus away from the Szécsényi and instead towards the Koszegis and Aba as potential allies respectively, as the Szécsényi seemed paradoxically too proud to be useful puppets but too weak to be effective at controlling Hungary.

His father, Ma Haiji, had rejected both the Mongols and Han calls for subjugation, and as such had his estate besieged by them. As the Chen Han forces encircled his father's estate, the young Ma He escaped the castle and fled to the coastline, eventually ending in the island of Yunnan. There, thanks to his Muslim background, he found refuge among some Arab merchants and traders. \n\n However, he decided that he was not fit for a simple trading life. Stealing several ships, he eventually carved a niche for himself as a smuggler and pirate in the region, slowly building up a dominant political force in the southern Chinese seas. By the early 1400s, Ma He was so powerful that even the Emperor in Beijing had to acknowledge his presence by sending a fleet to defeat him. However, the Pirate King defeated the forces sent by the Chen Han, and grew so bold to actively declare himself an independent state from that of Han China. From Liaoning to Canton, all feared the banners that flew from his ships, as he would take all that was valuable and leave bodies in his wake, and these treasure fleets as they were called reached so far as the Indian continent in the west. His state prospered in the chaos following the Han-Song War, and he became known as "The Pirate King of Hainan," as he also used these funds he gathered to build up the wealth of the people in Hainan, especially the poor. He also was known to say in front of women he wished to woo, women which he seemed to meet everywhere he turned. He would often court three or four women at a time, and was a frequent visitor of the brothels of Haikou. It is here the story of the great pirate ends - he was found dead in one of these establishments, laying peacefully beside a whore who was understandably concerned. Back at his headquarters, others were also worried. He had many an heir to succeed him, each with a strong vision for the future. \n\nAs a Hui Muslim, Ma He was the heir of many synergised traditions. He of course followed the teachings and sayings of the great sage Muhammad, whose name his family bears. His primary figure of veneration however was the sea goddess Mazu, whose authority over the ocean and seafaring is an important one for any sailor to respect. At the same time, he participated in various Buddhist rituals and traditions common to his people. Each of his three sons emphasize a different part of this eclectic tradition. His eldest led a raid on Yemen only to return home a changed man after a pilgrimage to Mecca. His middle child struggled the longest among the common sailors of the Treasure Fleet and saw the importance of continued devotion to Mazu. His youngest believes that the only way forward for the Treasure Fleet is better integration with the authorities that govern China, most of all the powerful temples scattered over the south."

#Sicily
 MR_sicily_flavor.1.t: "The Kingdom of Africa"
 MR_sicily_flavor.1.d: "Founded in the 11th Century, the Kingdom of Africa was a major project of Roger II, who wished to seize the economic bounty that was the Tunisian coastline. Indeed, through the efforts of many a Hauteville king, the provinces of Africa withstood Almohad and Hafsid incursions for over a century. This allowed the fledgling territory to establish roots in the region - it won over local elites with privileges and protections, the Muslim population were not persecuted or put to the sword, and the Chrisitan settlers further solidified a Norman presence. \n\nHowever, when the Hohenstaufens came into power in Sicily, Africa fell into disrepair. They were far more focused on expanding their own territory in Italy and in the Crusades, thus neglecting their fledgling colony and allowing it to slowly weaken and become threatened by its neighbors. Only through tribute and offering would Africa survive, paying off would-be invaders. This unfortunately also began a decline in relations, and by the year 1290, despite the restoration of a Hauteville on the throne of Sicily, Africa had functionally become independent from the mainland. Their economic and political woes did not cease, and over time revolts rocked the kingdom and eventually left it with barely anything left.\n\nAs we have now retaken the land of Tunisia, we have an opportunity to once more take up Roger II’s dream of expanding Africa, if we so wish."
 MR_sicily_flavor.1.a: "We shall recreate the Kingdom of Africa!"

 MR_sicily_flavor.2.t: "Fate of the Fraticelli Order"
 MR_sicily_flavor.2.d: "In the early 14th Century, just after the Hauteville line returned to the throne of Sicily, a disturbance had taken place across Sicily. An order of Fransiscan monks that preached the the value of Holy Poverty and removing corruption from the Church had arrived - the Fraticelli. These Spiritualists monks arrived in Sicily during their conflicts with other members of their congregation in Tuscany, and despite calls from the Pope to seize and investigate their holdings, the lords of Sicily chose to allow them to remain; the animosity towards the Papacy still ran hot, as they were responsible for several invasion against their homeland.\n\nIn the following century, the Spiritualists managed to expand their holdings and power, eventually winning over both common folk and elite families alike across Sicily. As the Vesper Wars raged in Naples, with the Papacy taking the side of the rebellious nobles, more of the Elite saw the Fraticelli as an alternative they could side with. So, by the 1400s, many of the most powerful provinces in Sicily had sided with and even adopted the new Fraticelli doctrine.\n\nBut the majority of our population are still devout Catholics. They do not wish to be excommunicated from the Church, and they do not agree with the claims laid at the foot of the Papacy. The issue remains prevalent to this day, as Fraticelli monks often harass agents of the Pope that try to infiltrate their regions of control - so, in [GetYear], the Hauteville Court convened to discuss what path they would take to manage this crisis."
 MR_sicily_flavor.2.a: "We shall purge the Fraticelli - they are heretical and must be removed!"
 MR_sicily_flavor.2.b: "We shall embrace the Fraticelli - they preach the truth!"

 MR_sicily_flavor.3.t: "The Catholic Revolt"
 MR_sicily_flavor.3.d: "Within the lands Sicily, a palpable tension rises as whispers of religious dissent grow louder. The clergy, staunch defenders of the Catholic faith, have become disheartened witnesses to the Sicilian Hauteville's apparent deviation from the traditional path. In a dramatic turn of events, a cadre of fervent priests, alarmed by the perceived abandonment of Catholicism, leads a revolt against the Sicilian monarchs who are turning towards the radical Fraticelli movement. Emblematic of the times, the battles are fierce and bloody, as priest and peasant fight against the changing times."
 MR_sicily_flavor.3.a: "Out with the old..."

 MR_sicily_flavor.4.t: "The Decadence of the Cathedrals"
 MR_sicily_flavor.4.d: "The winds of religious change sweep across the Sicilian landscape as the Hauteville nobles, once devout followers of the Catholic faith, now wholeheartedly embrace the Fraticelli movement. In a dramatic assertion of their newfound beliefs, the Hauteville rulers take a radical step against the established clergy, stripping them of their prized possessions and asserting their dominance over the Catholic Church. Falling in line with the Fraticelli doctrine of religious poverty, they claim it is a justified method for removing church wealth, but it has caused some chaos across the land."

However, the Afar, like many of the tribes of the northern plains, value raiding and attacking cities for wealth and prosperity. So, in 1444, the Afar launched a raid across the border regions with the Ifat, raiding homes, villages, and even the city of Zeila itself. The Ifat Sultan demanded an apology and restitution, but it did not come. So now, as relations crumble and the truce comes to a close, war seems inevitable between the two sultans."

 mr_startup_events.5.t: "The Waning Yoshino Period"
 mr_startup_events.5.d: "As Emperor Tsuneatsu sat upon the Chrysanthemum throne at the start of the Eikyo Era, there was much fanfare and anticipation. He was a bright and optimistic child, taught by scholars and monks alike. He could perform Shingon rituals while similarly practicing zazan through art and poetry. He was quick witted and articulate, able to win over a crowd of angry men with just a few kind words. He would be the emperor to finally rein in the growing power of the Shugo, the military constables of the Japanese provinces, a task not attempted since the early reign of his predecessor, Go-Kameyama.\n\nHowever, many Imperial courtier’s hopes were dashed when they saw something else emerge from the young emperor - his utter unwillingness to engage in conflict. He would often shy away when courtiers would argue within the court. He would have one of his many advisors order a traitorous Samurai's head to be removed, and he would find excuses to avoid his spies when they brought news from the countryside. All the while, the Shugo grew restless, and saw their ruler as weak, unprepared. They longed to return to the Kamakura Period, and sought to once and for all suppress imperial authority.\n\nIt is now the Kakitsu Era, and the Shugo’s authority continues to grow. In two decades, Emperor Tsuneatsu has begun to harden his resolve, and prepares for the coming age of turbulence, but still is cautious. He prays for a peaceful decade to any Boddhisatva who will listen, but he knows in the end his faith cannot protect him. He must stand as the emperor, as sovereign of Japan, and through might and force, secure his position as the only ruler of this domain."
 mr_startup_events.5.d.1: "With the defeat of Takauji Ashikaga at the hands of the loyalist forces of the Nitta, Shimazu, Hosokawa, and Hatakeyama, the ideal of a new shogunate seemed to be all but lost. After all, the Kamakura were long defeated and the loyalists betrayed Takauji for Emperor Go-Daigo, who wished to return to a time more akin to the Heian Period. However, all was not as it seemed. In order to win over said loyalists, the Shugo of Japan were granted extraordinary powers and protections, with the major Shugo even managing to create effectively self-governing realms for themselves.\n\nIn the Shugo land, they could tax, conscript, and judge their people however they saw fit, and even when Go-Kameyama managed to steal land back to imperial control, it was not enough to curb their growing power. So, when the timid Tsuneatsu came to power in the Eikyo Era, many Shugo dismissed him as a threat outright, and instead began to discuss amongst one another how best to undermine him. Influencing courtiers to feed them information, supplanting and removing Kokushi from their domains and instead replacing them with those more loyal to their Shugo counterparts.\n\nNow, in the Kakitsu Era, the struggle between the Emperor and his Shugo grows more extreme. The once loyal Nitta clan now lead the charge to defeat and overthrow Tsuneatsu, but still must operate in the shadows. They sneak messages through official channels, use monks as ambassadors to other Shugo, and martial their Samurai in secret - for even if the current emperor is weak, should they underestimate him, they could end this era without their power or their heads."
 mr_jap_4_TT: "We must bring down the §YShugo Authority§! through war or through diplomacy, lest we find ourselves defeated..."

While this would mean the end of the line of Bourgone in Iberia, we cannot deny that the aid of Navarran, Aragonese and Catalonian troops against the Islamic infidels could help us finally turn the tide for Christianity.

A crickety old ship she was, but reliable, weathered and familiar, or at least to the men onboard she was. It had left from the port of Honolulu and for two miserly blind weeks, the vessel surfed along the Maui lane towards Taiwan. Neither shark, nor cod, not even seagul had dared to make itself known against the wood of the Huntza, and so the sailors cursed the Holy Father.\n\n"Looks like we be scrapping her in Sakkam boys. It's alright, she's given us plenty". The captain said for both himself and his men, but more himself, feeling the olden wood and the generations of whaling battles that had left its mark upon it. Suddenly, came a yell from atop the crow's nest. "Whale!" All hands came in attention and saw as the great fin of a Humpback revealed itself from the furious waves. "All hands on deck! This is it boys!" The captain cried as suddenly the ship crested along the winds, pushing itself ever faster towards the whale. The harpooners took their spots and readied themselves for the payoff of their years long travels from Bizkaya."Get ready!" The captain yelled as he followed closely the whales movement with his spyglass, but then, terror, madness "Impossible." He said as the lurker from the deep revealed itself."\n\nThe whale was entangled, caught in the trap of a giant squid, as the illusive abbyssal collosus revealed itself to the men aboard the huntza. There was a brief pause, a brief moment of fear, but as he heard the creaking wood, and the whales cries the captain called to order. "Boys! You wanna live like kings?! Get me that Kraken!".\n\nThe Huntza docked in Sakkam a few days later, bearing in tow a large haul, larger than any flenser in Taiwan, nay, all of the Federation had ever seen. A veritable mob of onlookers had gathered as they came to see what the Huntza had brought. The crews smiles seemed promissing, and as the net was dragged, and the tarp removed, the proud old captain loudly proclaimed for the entire world to see. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you, the Kraken!"."

#Greek Events
MrGreekEvents.1.t: "The Unification of Rhomania"
MrGreekEvents.1.d: "In the wake of the tumultuous era that witnessed the fall of both the Byzantine Empire and the Latin Empire, a new power now begins to rise. The political chaos that followed the collapse of these once-great powers has created an opportunity for a bold and ambitious ruler to unite the fragmented lands under a new banner: a new day for Rhomania has arrived.\n\nWhile the old Byzantines were weak and cursed by God, and the Latins failed to manage those that served them, this new state shall control and dominate all of the lands of the Roman Empire and beyond. They speak of a new era where the Greeks will be united, where the enemies that have pillaged and destroyed the homes of the innocent shall be punished and defeated. With both the backing of the nobles and the church, there is none left to oppose them. Rhomania has been united once more, and the axis on which the world spins has been turned."
MrGreekEvents.1.a: "A Triumph for the Latins!"
MrGreekEvents.1.b: "A Triumph for the Hellenes!"
MrGreekEvents.1.c: "A Triumph for the Byzantines!"
MrGreekEvents.2.t: "The Raid on Tirnovo"
MrGreekEvents.2.d: "In the wake of the audacious Bulgarian raid on Adrianople in 1341, the Latins of Thracia prepared for glorious retribution. The city of Adrianople now echoes with the calls for justice and retribution. Thracian knights, adorned with the insignia of the Latin Crusade, gather aside the great gates of the ancient city, their spirits aflame with a burning desire to reclaim their honor.\n\nAs the sun sets over the horizon, the air is charged with anticipation. A solemn prayer floats through the air, drifting over the knights as they march. The echoes of past crusades reverberate through the line, infusing the atmosphere with a sense of divine purpose.\n\nWhen they arrive at Tarnovo, the righteous fury they unleash upon the Bulgars is mighty. With much struggle, the gates to the city were let loose, and the men stormed the city, ripping doors from hinges and slaughtering guards and civilians alike as they looted and plundered. Sacred items were stolen from reliquaries, gold and silver ripped from the pockets of dead men. Blood seeped into the stone roads, as fires rage through the wooden houses.\n\nWhen the sun rose, there was no glory or honor to be found. The men were forced to leave the destroyed city, as another battle was to begin on another plain, far away. A new prayer struck up from the marching lines - this one of forgiveness."
MrGreekEvents.2.b: "An Eye for an Eye."
MrGreekEvents.3.t: "The Kingdom of Epirus"
MrGreekEvents.3.d: "With our conquest of Arta and Thessaly complete, we now have become a dominant power within the lands of Rhomania. Within the magnificent city of Ioannina, our monarch rests atop a throne backed by both a bishop and a knight. All around him, the grand army of the Catalans flanks the sides of the great hall. When the crown was placed upon his head, he rose now a king of Epirus, reclaiming the title of the despotate that was defeated a hundred years prior. Now our armies march forward, preparing to conquer the rest of the states of Rhomania."
MrGreekEvents.3.a: "Hail to the King!"
MrGreekEvents.4.t: "The Euoboeate Succession"
MrGreekEvents.4.d: "In 1270, a crisis broke out between the local Triarch of Negroponte, Venice, and the Latin Empire. The house de la Roche, under the leadership of Guy de la Roche, had a rightful worry of the growing power of the lombard Triarchs, but the Venetian leadership had decided to back the Triarchs instead of supporting their desires. The conflict at most boiled over in street brawls and assassinations, but the Latin Empire and Venetian armies never met in battle. To this day, their house still lay claim to the provence, and have found some dusty old document to prove it. Should we grant it to them, it might alieviate us of the hassle of managing that state, however, it would be a lose of core Venetian territory."
MrGreekEvents.4.a: "Fine, discard of it."
MrGreekEvents.4.b: "If they want it, they must come and take it."
MrGreekEvents.4.Insight: "\n§GEvent Insight:§!\nThis event will demand that @VEN §YVenice§! grant us the title of Triarch of Negroponte. Should they accept, we shall gain ownership of the isle. Should they refuse, we shall gain a core on the province.\n"

MrGreekEvents.5.t: "The Treachery at Kocaeli"
MrGreekEvents.5.d: "In the shadows of the ancient walls surrounding Kocaeli, an ominous plot unfolds. The local garrison of native Greeks, in a shocking turn of events, betrayed their fellow Thracian guards in Kocaeli. Whispers of a clandestine agreement reached between the treacherous conspirators and the Ottoman forces have circulated, culminating in the fall of the once-impregnable fort.\n\nAs the sun sets on the tranquil waters of the Sea of Marmara, the silence is shattered by the thunderous march of Ottoman troops, stealthily guided by the duplicitous garrison. The city, lulled into a false sense of security, finds itself thrust into the chaos of betrayal and invasion.\n\nThe Thracian guards, unsuspecting of the impending danger, were caught off guard as the gates swung open to welcome the Ottomans. The echoes of steel clashing against steel reverberate through the narrow streets as the once-allies turn to bitter foes. By the end of the night, the Ottoman army held this once powerful fort, and the Istinople war of independence rages on."
MrGreekEvents.5.a: "The Greek and Turkish alliance bears fruit."

MrGreekEvents.6.t: "The Fall of the Latins"
MrGreekEvents.6.d: "With the defeat of the Baldwinids, we now rise a purple phoenix from the ashes. While our origins are those of scavengers, of cretins from the ruined streets of Istinople, we now stand as the conquerors of the Latins, the true heirs of the Roman Empire. We adorn ourselves with their colors, the imperial purple. As the Ottoman delegation applauded our Basileus on his accomplishments, he made sure to thank them and shake each of their hands. This alliance was forged in secrecy, but it is now rooted with trust and friendship. Together, they shall defeat their foes - the Rum Sultanate and the remaining squabbling Greek states. While we receive condemnation from the Thessalonicans and the Corinthian League, our Basileus ignores them. Why should he care for what traitors and barbarians think of the mighty Roman Emperor? They shall fall beneath his boot soon enough, begging for their lives. For now is the era of the Romaniae - and all shall know our might!"
MrGreekEvents.6.a: "...and we could never have done it without the Ottomans!"

MrGreekEvents.7.t: "The Phoenix Rises"
MrGreekEvents.7.d: "We have united Greece under the imperial banner. While the other states might have forgotten their heritage, their roots as Rhomanoi, we have not. We remain as we always were - sons and daughters of Rome itself. While once a vassal to the Latin Empire, and had weathered centuries of subjugation and humiliation, now however, an unexpected twist of fate now presents itself. As an unlikely ally, the Ottoman Empire, assists us with our conquest of Roman lands, many begin to whisper in the streets that the Emperor is the next Justinian, a man willing to conquer and reclaim what was rightfully his. The grandeur of the Byzantine Empire, once thought lost, has begun to flicker like a dormant flame; waiting to be rekindled."
MrGreekEvents.7.a: "Ave Imperator!"

MrGreekEvents.9.t: "The Goods of Istinople"
MrGreekEvents.9.d: "With the rebirth of the city into a new golden age, our industry has once more begun to flourish. Across the marketplaces and the merchants quarters, goods and services are bought and sold in large quantities for all to partake in. We have been hoping to invest our crown's considerable wealth into one of these industries, but we cannot decide which."
MrGreekEvents.9.a: "We should rebuild the Glass trade."
MrGreekEvenets.9.b: "We must invest in our Textile production."
MrGreekEvenets.9.c: "We shall produce the finest Jewels in all of Europe."
MrGreekEvenets.9.e: "We shall light the forges and craft new Weapons."


MrGreekEvents.10.t: "The Anatolian Candidate"
MrGreekEvents.10.d: "As we have grown closer and closer to our Turkish allies across the Hellespont, an interesting phenomina began to occur. The nobles of our kingdom increasingly intertwined these Turkish allies, despite their Muslim faith and heritage. As they became more entrenched within our upper class, some of our state's most devout warriors began to fall to this heathen religion. Interestingly enough, so did the Basileus' nephew, Alexandrios.\n\nThe Byzantine state is a curious one. The Universal Monarch was God's will incarnate on the planet, so if he were to gain power, his rule would be absolute, and his authority on religion, for example, would be so as well. While he is the laughing stock of his family, to the nobles and Turks who support him, he is a verifiable star. He would bring both power and legitimacy to those on the outskirts of the Byzantine state, and so, a devious plan was hatched. Get Alexandrios on the throne. With the death of the previous Basileus, his cousin is slated to be the next ruler. Should his plan work, he would be able to have his cousin meet an untimely end at the bottom of the Aegean Sea on his way to Constantinople. There would be some who reject Alexandrios, but many would support him.\n\nSo, on the eve of his Coronation, the would-be Emperor makes his way to Constantinople by horse, unaware of what is to come. Suddenly, a tree falls, blocking the road ahead. His guards pull their blades out, but they are quickly dealt with by a series of arrow bolts. A swarm of Greek, Turkish, and even a few remaining Latin mercenaries crawl out from the woodwork as the prince begins to run. He runs until he reaches the edge of a cliff, his back against the churning Aegean waters below, his enemies approaching..."

MrGreekEvents.10.a: "...and the boy accepts his fate, falling into the waves."
MrGreekEvents.10.b: "...and he manages to hide in a nearby bush, surviving another day."
kill_all_rebels_or_he_wins: "We must defeat all rebels and prevent them from seizing our Capital. If they do so, Alexandrios will become the next Basileus!"


MrGreekEvents.11.t: "The Razing of Venice"
MrGreekEvents.11.d: "Hundreds of years. We have been humiliated, occupied, and brutalized by foreign occupants for hundreds of years since the Fourth Latin Crusade and the siege of Constantinople. While those men have surely faced St. Peter when they reached the pearly gates, the ones who sent those monsters to us, the ones who orchestrated the tragedy of a most Greek kind, the Venetians, have escaped our wrath. Now, the city lies within our sights. First, we shall strip the boards from their ships, so their navy might never harass ours again. Then, we shall burn down their great pillars - they shall feel the same pain we felt upon the loss of our own great works. Finally, their people shall be disrupted, moved to foreign cities, and transferred so they might not congregate once more as they did. The dream of their flawed republic is done. Now, only songs and stories will tell of their grave misdeeds."
MrGreekEvents.11.a: "Thus, the age of crusaders has finished."
MrGreekEvent11Insight: "\n§GEvent Insight:§!\nThis event will detail our destruction and revenge upon the Venetians, who's actions led to the destructive crusade upon our lands."

MrGreekEvents.12.t: "The Basileus Goes to Mecca"
MrGreekEvents.12.d: "With our situation within the community settled, our Basileus [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided it was time to fulfill one a duty that all members of the Ummah must complete - the Hajj. While initially preparing a substantial host to come with, [Root.Monarch.GetName] eventually decided against such an act, instead deciding to go with some guardsmen and their personal retinue - the rest of the funds would be given to the people of Constantinople. The Hajj was meant to be a time of pious and humble reflection, not grandstanding and posturing.\n\nOur Basileus’ time in Mecca was enlightening, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] claimed to have a deeper understanding of the true nature of the faith. Indeed, the Muslim world far and wide recognized this once Empire, once a foe of their people, now united in faith and spirit. All across Byzantium, the faithful cheer and pray for our Basileus’ faithful return. Now his guidance, his wisdom, his teachings will bring them even closer to the words of Allah and the Prophet - they can act as one, throughout all of the land."
MrGreekEvents.12.a: "A Most Humble and Pious Journey"

mr_egypt.1.t: "Challenge to the Vizier"
mr_egypt.1.d: "Officially, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] may be appointed by the Imam of the Age, in actuality the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is simply the minister or general with the most support in the [Root.GetAdjective] court. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to govern comfortably for a number of years, but the many [Root.GetAdjective] cliques have decided the time is right to test that support. Alliances are made, rivals are eliminated, bonds of loyalty are tested, and as the dust settles..."

mr_egypt.2.t: "Race for the Viziership"
mr_egypt.2.d: "As news spreads of the passing of [Root.Monarch.GetName], the upper echelons of [Root.GetName] are thrown into disarray as the viziers and commanders scramble over the seat of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Allegiances shift, and threats are eliminated. The cliques race to the Imam-Caliph's palace to make their case, but soon enough it becomes clear which person has become the most influential in the court..."
